Love the quality,2nd time purchased from this store
Nice,Very comfortable
If they actually worked fully....,Works okay.  Little pricey for them though.
More shedding than my dog!!,"I wanted to like the bed and at first it worked great, it fit perfectly in my dogs crate and he seemed to be comfortable enough with it. HOWEVER, it sheds like CRAZY! I had read a review talking about that, but I decided to buy it anyways cus it could’ve just been their bed. Turns out it’s mine too. Every single day I would have to vacuum inside and around on the outside of his crate because the fur balls that would come off the bed were so much that they would get carried out around the living room (where the crates at) by the normal inside air. It was so annoying. Not to mention my dog has allergies and the amount of fur that came off the bed was very uncomfortable for him to the point he couldn’t sleep in his crate with that bed. It was a problem for me because his crate doesn’t have a base (it was a hand-me-down crate) so the bed had to be there or he would be even more uncomfortable. Anyway, point is this bed although seemed to work for the price, now has to been thrown away because it is completely useless to me and no amount of vacuuming stops the fur from coming off. I imagine the bed would have to be furless for that to happen. So waste of money there."
love this cup,Perfect for  cup of tea
Colorful and looks nice on my front porch.,Perfect for what I needed.
Size,"Great for small kitchens, highly effective (:"
Great hat,Great hat
Overall a beautiful puzzle,"Love him!! Been waiting to get him for a while and now he's finally part of my collection. I say it's easy to assemble because of experience, if you're a first-timer for the Crystal Puzzles he might be a little easy to do, just depends. Arrived within two days of shipping and he's a beautiful light ocean blue, stands out from a lot of the main colored puzzles I have."
For everyone who loves maple syrup,Love the flavor. This is the first real great tasting sugar-free maple syrup that I have ever bought.
Great,So easy to use and made my winter mornings so much quicker. It’s fast to install and easy to take take off. The video tutorial they have for this product was also very helpful.
Black garlic,"I like the product , I eat one every day great taste"
The black face mask looks exceptional.,Love the look of these face masks except for the colors. The black one is very nice & looks phenomenal. The other colors not so much.
Broken,"Broken, not functioning. The string is cut so it won’t open. I will be returning it!!!"
Amazing,So I got the one size regular. I am 5’6 and 176 lbs. I also have a little baby pouch from having kids lol when I first looked at them upon delivery they looked small. I tried them on. There was some extra leg length that bunches up some but not bad. They’re extremely soft. They hid my pouch pretty well. I can also lift my legs high and squat with no feeling of gaining tightness on my legs or anywhere. So they are pretty stretchy as well. I’m happy with them.
Dry gas shiing,Works well
Expensive for what you get,I use 9 gallons of water to fertilize all my succulents on the porch. One entire bottle is only good for 8 gallons.
Perfect family beach towel,"This is the perfect beach towel! I wanted something large enough to fit me, my husband, and my young daughter comfortably, along with all of our beach gear that we want to protect from sand. It comes with stakes and packets to fill with sand to weigh it down, which is great so I don’t have to worry about putting something in each corner. I also intend to use this inside our beach tent to make it more waterproof. It’s light weight and small when packed up. A must-have for every beachgoer."
Not worth the money,I purchased this as a gift once the child received it it did not work it was poorly made and a waste of money. Wanted to return and it cost just as much to ship it back as the item itself.
Did not fit,Bought this for 2014 Dodge Dart SXT and they did not fit.  Perhaps not compatible with alloy wheels?  They should specify wheel type in fit guide.
Easy to clean,I love how durable the straws are and it's easy to clean. My children love the straws.  I normally use them at work to avoid displaying plastic straw.
As advertised.,Excellent braze alloy. Will buy again.
Can move around easily & charge will using oynjm,Love the length of this cord 10 ft.
Proven in a 24hr adventure race,I wore these for a 24hr adventure race and was pleased. I was worried my backside would get overly sore with 90+ miles of biking but faired no worse than I’d expect to in fully padded bike shorts. They held up well over 30+ miles of trekking in that race with no chaffing or discomfort. I did wear UA boxer briefs underneath as I could feel the seam of the pad against my skin without them and didn’t want to risk irritation over that distance.
Great,Great! It works.
Do not buy,Already fading to white.
not as pictured,"I ordered this because the picture shows a splash guard with a cut out at the narrow end to hold the down spout.  The one that arrived did not have this feature and so, is of no use to me. Will be returning."
Just buy it,Just what i needed. Fast shipping.
Good Product,It is very easy to use and clean So far the food has been good
Fantastic,"Excellent quality. Easily on-par with much more expensive straps, and in some cases much better. This is my second W&W strap and it won’t be my last."
Get a grip. literally,"Fits my huge hands well. a little awkward to clip on (you gotta thread the wrist strap through a hole in the bottom, and must be taken off to replace the batteries, but once they're on, they aren't moving."
Easy to use.,It’s very handy. Light and easy to use.
comfortable,works great
"Great value, durable product","Bought for the overall value since a toddler bucket seat is on average $40-$50... and I'm very satisfied. The bucket seat is great quality, and now I have a spare swing, and my 6 year old loves the wheel spinning thing.."
Love this Washi Tape & I will buy again,I love this Washi tape. I use it around the borders of my Diamond Paintings. It holds up very well. The colors are beautiful. I will be buying again.
"Worth the buy, but......",I wished it would have had a plastic covering to protect the photo I inserted.  Other than that it’s pretty nice.
Perfectly bright!,Perfect gift for my teenage daughter who practices applying makeup.
I will be buying the black purse I love this,"I love the quality of this purse, and yes, I will buy the black one as well. It’s very sophisticated, it looks expensive it’s lightweight and very classy"
Easy to use,"Good product, fast shipping,easy to use"
YAY!,I so appreciate taking 1/4  of a teaspoon of  Natural Vitality Calm #1 Selling Magnesium Citrate PLUS Calcium three times a day along with 1/4 of a teaspoon of Bragg's Apple Cider Vinegar. I highly recommend it to my loved ones. *Much Love* MV
Best ever,Smells so good amd hair is shiny�
Still wondering where the bracelet is...,"I never received my free gift or the bracelet that was supposedly part of the package and what originally drew me to purchase this item out of the gate. The ring itself is of good quality and is comfortable to wear. I just wish for the money spent that the bracelet advertised with the item would have actually been included, because that was the deciding factor for me to purchase this item over others I had seen."
Lights Don’t Last,"Easy to install, but adhesion ruins wall upon removal. Lights don’t last long with brand new batteries."
As advertised,"Simple, clean design, no defects. Easy to install."
Think I got a defect,"Had a pair before, great headphones and very comfortable.  What else can you say about AirPods."
Great value,Works great for the price! It was a little bulky but not heavy. Good for camping.
Is good to buy it,I really do like and it worki really good
Nice deal,"Mats work nice using for dead lifts, protects floor from damage"
Dead in 2 months,Seemed to work pretty good but I’ve had this for about two months and only used it to sharpen my kitchen knives and it’s already dead. Unit seemed to run rather hot tbh. Went to sharpen my knife set and I got through two before a strong smell of melting plastic paired with extreme heat caused the unit to fail.
Decent and works,Easy to install but thought it tilted left and right. Works perfectly for the bedroom.
Perfect attire for end of the day!,The best outfit for the end of the day..soft and comfy!
Great mascara for the price!,I'll definitely purchase this product again.  It stays on really well. The only issue I have is that it's not pretty to take off.  I look like I have 2 black eyes when I go to wash my face even when using an eye makeup remover prior to washing.  Other than that it's a great product!
Very cute and hopefully we use it someday!,"It’s very compact and easy to clean. The design is super cute. However, my toddler refuses to sit on it, because she’s terrified of “the big potty.” I’m hoping in time we will use it more but I think it’s a great product for the price."
Dad likes it.,"Bought this for my dad and he's happy with it. I was a little concerned, because it didn't expand most of the way when unwrapped but he said it did expand to fill the cover by the next day."
Stream from duck’s bill is tiny.,"The only aspect that was disappointing was the size of the stream from the ducks bill, tiny and beyond tiny. My cat loves to drink from the bottom of the fountain but not the stream. He likes to drink from the bathroom faucet so i thought he would on this. Maybe he can’t see the timy stream!"
Nice Quality,"Nice quality, effective and durable"
Fall Pumpkin Sets!！,Very good value set. You get so much! So many different colored pumpkins. And the garland vine is very full and the leaves are very life-like. Would definitely recommend. Provided a photo when I was testing out the dining table.
Cheap price Cheap audio.,"I have never had good thing to say about Beats audio equipment. I have always thought they were over priced and poor quality. These fall under that same category. Even with the provided different ear bud foam sizes, they don't stay in your ears. The sound quality is real bad, especially at higher volumes. The bass gets distorted."
Very good,I really like this. The audio is clear and crispy. Easy to set up. The only complaint is that the stand is sometimes annoying (it is hard to make it stand up without falling)
Easy on/off and durable,"I bought these to use when I help in the warehouse handling large, awkward boxed items. The grip is good and they seem to be wearing well. No holes or tears after a few weeks of daily use. I have blown through some other gloves in little more than a day. Overall I’m pleased with these."
!BUY IT!,"Price is unreal for this product! Fluffy and light weight. As soon as I got it, I threw it in the wash. This is usually the part where I can tell if it’ll be total crap because cheap ones will dry funky or clump up without ever getting fluffed up as once bought. This comforter was an easy wash and dried up great (especially since I had to re wash it after forgetting in the washer ????)! Looks and feels great! Was originally going to be a spare but it’s in my regular rotations now, when my kids aren’t trying to take it! I’m hoping they come out with more prints but if not, might just have to pick up another one."
10/10 Hisoka,This is the best purchase I’ve ever made! He’s perfect for guarding your cat litter (and sleeping with). My cats may sometimes attack him but that’s their problem ????
Great product,Works great
Top small bottom normal sizing,Very small in arms and shoulders
Love them,They arrived perfectly! Love them
Amazing little mop,I was SHOCKED when I was finished mopping for the first time using the Sandoo mop for my mop pad was filthy! My floors looked so much better amd they were dry within a matter of minutes
Excellent product,Very comfortable:) Doesn’t feel like an air mattress at all!
�,Great sticker! Fit nicely on my hard hat...
The only trap that works,No mess. This really works.
"Good for everyday use, not great on airlines anymore","It was perfect, especially getting throughout the airlines at first. I could actually breathe with this one. But then the airlines have recently caught on and are not allowing people to board with these mesh style masks. Otherwise, I love them and and use them anywhere else people are still demanding masks."
Very good chair,"great overall chair, very convenient arm rest and comfortable seating. 10/10"
I WILL be buying more of these!,"I LOVE these pants! I’m 5’6” and 176lbs, with thicker legs and a smaller waist. I purchased an xl and they fit perfectly. They feel so good on and compliment all the right places."
"Very quiet, nice design","Needed a new microwave  bought this one and right away I noticed how it doesn't make a lot of noise while operating and you can turn off the ""beeping when finished "" feature so you don't have to hear that either. It has a metal-like looking door which goes well with stainless steel appliances. It has a sensor pad built in that I have used to cook potatoes so it knows how long to cook them you can use it for other foods too. It comes with a great operating manual, actually 2 speperate ones -in English and one in Spanish. I'm still learning all the bells and whistles but I'm very pleased with my purchase."
Out of stock.,Great coloring and variations of size of boards. These boards are thicker then most which is what I was looking for. However...I gave a 3 because they are out of stock. I ordered about a month ago to see if I’d like it (actually ordered 3 different rolls) and decided I really liked this one. Went to reorder and it is “currently unavailable” in the brown. I’ve tried reaching out to see if it will become available in the newest future but no one has responded.
Love it,Love it
It's pretty cute. I like it,"Very delicate packaging, every day to open the door into the home on a light fragrance, the mood will become good, feel very good"
Very stiff.,"I am sending this back. It's supposed to be tangle free but when I took it out of the package, this hair was extremely stiff. You could barely separate the pre separated pieces because the ends felt matted together. I am disappointed because I saw so many Youtube videos that said this hair was great to use. It's a hard pass for me."
Cute summer decor,Super cute and exactly as shown.
Great diffuser,Easy to set up. Diffuses oil nicely - lightweight long cord if need to reach a plug
Love this product,Less hassle with all the chargers together. Charges fast and looks good too.
Great maneuverability and easily removable tray,"Loved this chair from the first try! All what was important for me was there and I’m happy! Maneuverability is good on the carpet and kitchen tile. Tray can be removed with one hand and hidden behind the chair with one click! It was easy to clean small mess off of it, will see how it works with yogurt or tomato sauce eventually. Overall I’m very happy!"
Super cute,It has a nice bit of stretch. Absolutely looks like you'd imagine.
A hit!,This was the talk of my husband's 40th!  Loved!
simulates a rain shower.,"This is the best I have found over all the years I've been planting delicate flowers and vegetables.  Most other shower heads beat tender vegetation down, doing more damage than good.  Made to last of metal it has a comfortable coating for a better grip."
Just what I needed...,"I just needed a simple trash can to place in front of our food truck. Although it didn't come with a lid or wheels we bought those separately. Is it pricey? Possibly but whatever, I'm satisfied."
Just what I needed,The heavy bottom is effective at precise temperature control during heating. The stainless steel is easy to clean and able to withstand scratching from power mixers
Great and handy,Love how it works and how fast it came.  Super easy to use.
Print quality and speed are excellent.,"Have trouble with multi pages on auto feed.  Only takes first page, then jams."
Good straws for the price.,"The straws are quite easy to use, clean and maintain. Quality seems good so far. Daughter loves her rainbow one."
it works!,"easy to apply, no mess, no smell.  it's working!!"
All the garden tools a girl needs,The set has all the item my daughter needed. I thought they are toys and did not expect the quality to be useable. But it came a surprise. Now my daughter would take her tools out to work with me in the garden every day.
Excellent,Excellent
Nice product,"These socks are comfortable. Additionally, I do feel that there are benefits for health conditions  - my feet do not hurt as much as before. The one drawback is that the socks are fraying after just a few washes."
Cute sweater,Very cute little sweater. Good quality.
Todo lo demás bien,Él pega no sale muy bueno
Where’s the poster?,"I like Buffalo puzzles, particularly Aimee Stewart’s puzzles.  I’m surprised and disappointed that there was not a poster included. The listing said one would be included. I’ve noticed a few others have made the same comment."
Stains on the ceiling,"The kids love them, but, beware the stains."
It doesn’t work the printer will not except it. Now I’m out the $,Waist of $ will not work
Poor screen cover,Case is good but screen cover didn't last a day. Wouldn't read finger print and didn't adhear to screen. We could be nice if top plate held cover down.
Great Except for Tiny Slots in Bottom,I like this little caddy. Nice tough plastic. Would have been perfect except for the little slots in the bottom which I covered with plastic. Using it to store computer repair tools.
Perfect,"To say I love this is an understatement.  Looks great, easy to install and fits great where I put it."
Looks correct broke easily,Was beautiful but broke within a couple of days. Might be because my wrists are large?
"Large bag, but I question durability","The value for the money is good, I gave them 4 stars only because opening the bag is hard and it tears easily."
Dog responds to cues,"So far so good , its been a few days and dog is responding well"
Worked great!,Easy to use. Found the after spray inside packed inside of the warmer.
the worst,the heat melted the finish and stained my cook top. i would give it a zero stars if i could
"Good quality, fun, simple!",Very pretty! Very easy. Love how it was packaged. It came with 3 strands separated in individual packaging. The strands are nice and long. Good quality too. Love that I can use them multiple times.
"Dried up paint, completely unusable",I cannot review the product as all the paint is dried up and completely unusable
Great deal,"These gloves are exactly what i was looking for. Very comfortable to wear, good grip, really helped reduction of corns on my palms."
*For ATH-M50X* About low-star reviews.,"Okay, so let's nip this in the bud. The people who left bad reviews because their ""sound stage changed"" and ""it sounds like X, Y, and also Z!"" - take it with a grain of salt. There's a few reasons for this. First and foremost... duh. It's like moving your speaker that was 2 feet away and surrounded in concrete, to 4 feet away and surrounded in wood. Anyone who orders these thinking the sound will not change shouldn't be writing clarity-centric reviews trying to sound like an audiophile. Because an audiophile wouldn't even get these. Master Technicians don't get Harbor Freight tools, they get Snap-On."
the Ratchet belt is very nice and resistent to use all time,"nothing bad to report, it's a good belt."
It works and that is what I am all about.,I love it as safety precautions
Works great! Super easy to assemble,"When I first saw the box, I thought, ""This is going to break easily"". Nope. It is super strong. I weigh almost 300 lbs and I can sit on it without a problem. And I assembled it in less than 5 minutes."
High quality and great value,My Sig P365 fits like a glove. The lock feature works great and I am very pleased with the comfort.
Sizes are real small,This was way small
They don't work in my AC5000E,"Tried both filters in my unit and neither worked, unit wouldn't turn on. put the old filter back in and unit turned on as normal. These are much flimsier then the OEM filters and I think the might be stooping the sensors from letting unit turn on."
It's not quite to my taste,It's a little spicy. Flavor isn't quite my preference but this is subjective so I can't knock it for that.
Love it,Love love love this belt the make is super awesome the firmness everything about this belt is well made true to size color is good. Happy happy happy with this buy
broken already!,bought this in 2020 but didn’t start using it until 2 months ago. I weight 115 lbs & husband weighs 155 lbs. both chairs are broken from the plastic elbow. not sure what happened.
Perfect size,Perfect size for my business
They work well,At first I wasn’t sure they were  going to stick together as I needed. But after figuring out where the adhesive was I was able to wrap my dinner ware. This is a pre-preparation project and when I went to get the dinnerware they wraps were still snug so I was very happy. With COVID we have to wear gloves and these wraps don’t stick and tear. Good product
Learn to use,Very nice product if you follow directions.
Excellent Performer,"I got this because I was just starting out in ice fishing and didn't want to spring for a power auger right away.  It is easy to use, and I can cut an 8-in hole in 7 in thick ice in about 2 minutes.  I am very happy with my choice."
Stopped working after 3 months,"Always liked these heaters. The 500w I got for a 40b worked great since purchased in late March. Came home and nothing. No lights, won't turn on. My saltwater tank water was at 65 degrees. Two dead fish due to the stress. Would like an exchange or refund!"
Good cat tower for a good price,"A decent quality cat tower, not the top of the line but good for the price point."
Relief,Effective; easy to use; well priced healthy alternative to other products on the marker.
What is Galentine’s day,Needs to be under Galentine’s day not Valentine’s Day guess I’m the sucker that bought it but no thank you it’s going back
Fits very well!,I like how it fits and feel and material is cool enough for you to breath. Good product and well worth to buy.
Love them,Pretty cool lights for my diy backdrop.
very pleased,received it very fast.  well-packaged.  very pleased.
Indoor fun!,Bought for my grandson for his birthday.  He loved it.  He did say balls were too bouncy for the space he had in his room.
Just what I wanted,"Just perfect, very soft mesh and fits Just right. It's not too tight and not too loose. Worth the price for sure and the lettuce hem is very cute."
Cute but non-stick,"The nail design and shape on these is SO CUTE, but beware - the stickies it comes with do not work at all. Within 30 mins of applying, nails started coming off! So sad because I had such high hopes"
Beautiful,"I love the fabric, they are blackout even are ivory color. I love how they look in my bedroom."
Easy to use,"After receiving the drying rack, I checked that the parts are complete, and the assembly is very simple. There is an installation manual with a glance. The installation is very strong and durable. It is more than enough for hanging schoolbags, hats, clothes and suitcases.  Occupying space, so many clothes finally have a place to put them, the house is no longer messy, it is very practical and I like it."
Modern and older shape all in  one.,Fits well with my bath
Buena calidad,Muy bonito
IT WORKED!,CANT BELEVE THIS WORKED! I struggled with a diagnosed BV/ yeast infection for about 6 months and NOTHING was working including oral fungal pills from my doctor. I had this product referred to me by a friend and in 3 weeks i was officially free from 100% of my symptoms. i never had flare ups (which amplified before and after my period) again. I took it in unison with boric acid pills which also CLEARED me completely. SO HAPPY!
Excellent!  Study and effective,"Great strainer.  I've now purchased 2.  Perfect for straining whey out of homemade yogurt, and 100 other uses."
Nice product,It's liked by the one for whom it was bought
Good for low weights,It is useful for <10 lb but not good for heavy weights as it says
Didnt work.,Dog had it on for about 30 mins. The vibration didnt effect him at all. Neither did the warning beeps. Would not reccomend for strong willed dogs.
Good alternative for discontinued IKEA Ektorp sofa covers.,"I've had the slipcover on my IKEA Ektorp corner sofa for about a month. It looks great! It doesn't fit perfectly, but it fits about as well as the IKEA slipcover did. While I prefer the feel of cotton, the polyester isn't too bad. Overall, I have to say that I'm pretty impressed & would order from this company again."
Great decanter.,Perfect size for a standard sized bottle of wine.  Easy to hold and pour with the bottom finger dimple.  Love this style of decanter.
Simple but wonderful,My wife loves it
Bright LED strip. Best I've seen so far.,The adhesion is about average for these strip lights. The brightness is great. If you plan on running the whole strip white at full brightness you will need to wire power to both ends minimum. The colored patterns look great even with power just on one end.
Perfection.,Perfect! Product came rather quickly and in perfect condition. And it has these cute little extra clips! So cute and definitely worth the price!
A very good product,This was a gift they really liked it
Great cords,Very very good for the price. Have lasted for awhile so far.
Better than your standard raincoat,This rain jacket is lined but lightweight.
Exact replacement,Exact replacement for my Craftsman 917.370680 mower.
Works as Advertised,"I uses this with a deep cycle battery during a recent weather event that created rolling blackouts. We used it to keep phones an iPads charged. I could have used a smaller unit for that purpose, but I sized this so I could use it to run refrigerator if necessary."
Words need to be darker,Great frame. The words didn’t really show up consistently on the frame though. It’s laser cut but only some areas got hot enough to make a darker color. Makes it hard to read.
Great vest,I love the best it fits real comfortably. I thought it would of felt heavier but not. Good quality
LOVE THIS,This is the best product. I cant believe that something so great would be so inexpensive! The heat feature is so nice and my boyfriend who plays lots of sports uses it all the time. It feels so nice and really helps my neck and back
junk,This bike is cheap and does not help at all. Useless and its a waste of money should not be in the market.
It works,Ease of use
Fun Game,Good quality
Great bargain!,"Nice looking shoe at a fraction of the price of similar shoes.  Great value and looked as good as the other more expensive shoes. It fit well and is comfortable. Very lightweight. Sock shoes like these donʻt have the support like other sneakers, so, by the end of a full day, my feet hurt.  However, other shoes might have felt the same way.  Regardless, at that price, I would definitely buy it again."
Could be softer,"I like the idea of two threads, indeed it makes the flossing easier and cleans better. However I find the threads too hard. The ones I had before were softer and more gentle to my gums."
Great for tall people,My husband is 6'5". This upright walker allows him to stand straight and not hurt his back. He is very pleased.
Awesome,Worth buying
False advertising,"I'm so upset with these pieces of junk. Most weren't anywhere near the sizes advertised here and the one that were are completely unusable due to splits, chips and cracks. For the price they are charging for this petrified elephant excrement you could go to a craft store and get better ones. Heck, chip some concrete off the sidewalk and it would be better. Do not waste your money!"
Smells so good,Donated product but this cologne smells amazing
Holds up well,I use it daily as a Hospice Nurse. It reads well in this frail population.
It is comfortable and easy to place.,"It is comfortable and easy to place,"
Not entirely leather on the outside!,"Description says this is a leather bag and/or I missed the part about the non-leather slide pocket?? To me, this looks far different in person than it did in the pictures and the video in the listing. It’s not attractive at all, and I’m going to return it. I initially thought I’d accidentally gotten a fake but then noticed others reporting this in their reviews.  I guess I should have read them first, but the reason I didn’t was because I had bought a really similar bag from this company in the past; thus, I may not have been discerning enough in reading about this one. Either way, the difference in materials is not the look for me, especially given the price I paid."
Very close match. Very satisfied. Would order again.,Very satisfied. Easy to apply. Color very close.
Awesome,Exc product
Soft and comfortable!,"This shirt is so soft and comfortable! The fit is good but the only negative thing is that it's a little short and could stand to be a little longer at the bottom. Hopefully, it won't shrink when I wash it. Really happy with it!"
sharp,"easy to use, easy to hold, very sharp wheel.  Make sure you close the guard around the wheel before taking apart because you can easily cut yourself while disassembling the cutter."
Perfect,Nice and easy to use. Just what I wanted.
True fit,Fits like they should
Durable,One of my new pup’s favorite toys!
Great Product!,Great Value!
Awesome,Great product!! Very sturdy
Ext cord,Very good for a space air conditioner that was a little too far away from the outlet. No problems at all with it.
Was a gift,Fit great
Just what I needed,"Easy to use, good adhesion. Clean and dry area to be caulked. You cut off the tip at a 45º angle, squeeze out a narrow bead, and shape with a wet finger if necessary.  Replace the cap when finished. Give it 24 hours and you can use the shower/tub/whatever you caulked. Good value for the money."
No,The color is so bad in person
not percale,"I love percale sheets -I like the cool crispness of them year round. I get that others like sateen, flannel, etc. but me - percale. I bought these because I needed 'deeper' sheets for a new mattress and they claimed to be percale. They are not in anyway a percale sheet -and they are scratchy. I've washed them many times -still scratchy. Soft, clingly, scratchy sheets."
Disappointed,I love the design but after 3 months of regular use 2 of the bowls started chipping.
They set the bar!,Packaging was perfect! I'm so glad it came packaged in a box and not a bag! Shipping was fast and the product was.....BEAUTIFUL!
Blades,Works as advertised
Very good product.,Mosquito repellent and tick repellent.
Cuts the grease,This shampoo did a great job of helping to control how greasy my hair gets. It's way better than other shampoos aimed at greasy hair.
Small,Love these but smaller than I anticipated
Great product,Great product and service
Best diffuser for curly hair,Works great. So glad I got this.Way better than the diffuser attachments that you can buy. Also very handy that you can take the diffuser part off if you need.
Must have for safety on ladders,"After using a friends ladder with these, I've outfitted three of my extension ladders and will buy two more soon so I have them on all of them.  For working on uneven ground these work great and provide much safer stability than trying to shim one side with wood/etc.  These adjust very easy.  When it comes to ladder safety these are worth every penny vs having a ladder fall."
Perfect,Great poly bag set.
Amazing results,I am so impressed with my purchase
Worth every penny,Love these pillowcases don’t wake up sweating like I use to and able to sleep through the night.
great deal,"my only complaint would be that the box was covered in white dust/residue. somewhat of a concern considering I bought this for smokeables. but, the grinder is decent and the metal containers are great. I use this box as a bedside backup basically and it's pretty much perfect. you guys should throw in an ashtray that fits in one of the smaller sections and a poke tool and raise the price and it would be perfect!"
Great for a big man,I love how the mattress adjust to my body The sleep quality is the best
Lightweight & comfortable- Screws keep coming loose,I love my glasses but am disappointed because the screw on two of the three pair that came with my order keep coming loose and I had to buy a new one. Disappointed this is a reoccurring problem because I really like the glasses.
Poor quality,The connectors work well until you move the device that it’s plugged into then it loses connection and quit playing whatever media is being played
Not quite like the pictures.,The product looks good but definitely not like the pics. The color looks faded in comparison to the vibrant colors in the pics.
Perfect!,Great quality no issues installing at my car!
"Kind of thin, heats up really fast","The pot seems a little thin, which i think might be bad.  I'm not an expert, but things heat up faster than with my other pot, maybe that's good?  There is a tendency for stuff like chili to get too hot, even on my gas stoves' lowest setting, stuff bubbling like mad when on Warm...that's not good is it? I had to adjust to where there's hardly any flame at all to get my chili to just simmer( light bubbling).  So far no problem with sticking."
THESE ARE AMAZING!! CHANGED MY DOGS LIFE,"If your dog has seasonal or food allergies GET THESE! Skin rashes, hot spots, ear infections all gone. Made the mistake of forgetting to order some once and my dog immediately broke out until I bought more."
Buy one size larger than you wear for shrinkage.,This product is great for any working person. You must buy at least one size larger than you wear due to shrinkage during washing.
Perfect!,"Perfect for storing lunch,  snack and breakfast items for the school year!"
EXCEPTIONAL condition,Packaged with the BEST protection for the box and literally in pristine condition. I wish everyone protected their products like you!
Not a fun bike to ride.,The price I paid for this bike is not worth it. Too small tire and very low clearance. Short driver handel makes it difficult to control
Quality ingredients,Used this product for immune support burning these times. Since taking these I have not had a cold or any type of respiratory issues
Great Robe!,Love this robe! The weight is perfect - not bulky but plenty warm.
Lovely,Lovely
Great Product - Poor Documentation,This product works well although would sell better if the company hired me to do a grammer and spell check on the paperwork. The current documents make the product seem less than legit.
Buddha.,Very good .
Adequate for cars party.,Very funny for cars.
Yum,Best Atkins bar ever !!
Great buy!!!,My daughter absolutely loves these headphones!!! The regular kind don't stay in her ears for some reason so I bought these for her instead. Now all she ask me is if she can wear her headphones all day. She's 4 and likes to listen to music a lot. I was tired of hearing the same 4 songs over and over again so this was my solution and I don't regret it at all. Great buy!
Works great!,Works exactly like how I wanted! It made my dog calmer when I left him at home and not as anxious! Perfect!
Never seen cracks like this!,Spider web like cracks on the front of the plates!! haven't had them 1 month yet and they are cracking!! Should've just kept using paper plates and saved my money!!!
Chemical odor,Very strong chemical odor from bands.  Will be returning.
Easy to use,I like the handle so you can stay out of the water in the bowl.  Cleans stains great.
as pictured,Item arrived quickly. Exactly as pictured. There were only a few unusable pieces due to broken or defect.
Very Detailed Painting,Keep in mind that you will need small tools to put together the frames and attach the canvas.  The paint by numbers  process is great for beginners.  Some of the numbers may be a little hard to read in some spaces for those with eyesight challenges
Awesome,The security lights work as advertised
Grip should be on both sides not just one,Thought they would be good grip for my tri pod dog/ but they move constantly… the grip is only on one side so if they move-  no more grip.
Good,Notice difference in skin and hair
Excellent!,Very powerful immersion blender.  I love how easy it is to clean too!
Works perfectly for stereo rig.,This product was perfect for my inexpensive wet/dry stereo pedal board. This is my 2nd Dinner pedal and I am continuously impressed by the value.
"Beware, cheap looking!!","Received these shoes on Saturday and was excited to wear, but they look so cheap, uncomfortable, the sole is hard."
Waste of money,I bought 2 of these. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. These are just fans that do not push much air out.
Works easy,Nice an eazy
Great!,Box was damaged a bit but it was held in an Amazon bag. All of mine worked fine. The flashlights seem pretty bright and the alarms are all very loud.
AWESOME,"Ordered a 2xl.  Normally wear a 20/22.  Plenty of room,  perfect stretch and fit"
Loving it,It fits perfectly.  I bought a xl so could have a snug fit. It's not tight or anything and it stays in place. Thanks
Best price,Best one ever
Great Fit,Was very happy with this coil I thought I would not be able to find this part for such a odd engine. Thanks
????,Great protection items around the kitchen and countertops
Cheaply made,I planned to use it for the beach but it’s cheaply made. I do not feel it is sturdy.
Uneven flavor.,I love this kind of popcorn and I decided to give the bowl a try. The butter does not distribute evenly over all the popcorn (in all 12 buckets) and there’s extreme amount of salt. You’ll be satisfied at first with its buttery taste but as you get further down into the bowl there’s hardly any flavor. You also have to be on top of when it finishes popping or else the bottom of the bucket gets burnt and you risk burning your popcorn. In my opinion you got more flavor distributed in the single serving bags.
Good buy,Works well
Creative grids 5x15 ruler,Favorite brand ruler! Makes measuring and cutting quilt blocks easier
Nice shirt,Nice shirt
Doesn’t fit,Second seat I’ve bought and doesn’t fit my toilet
Duller than the 5yr old blade im replacing - bad knockoff,"The blade is not sharp at all. It's much duller than even the 5yr old one that I'm replacing, totally useless product and just a bad knock-off."
Not for everyday sitting,"Perfect for my small space, assembly required no effort very easy , sturdiness not good I have to keep tighting the screws and we only sit at it about twice a week so it shouldn't be happening"
Buen producto!,Buen producto!!!
"Best for speech, sturdy, comfy, calls so so.","As other stated the bass sounds are reduced for music, but works terrific for podcasts etc. The power on power off volume cannot be adjusted and should be turned on or off we’re not attached to your ears. It is very very loud. It is easy to have these headphones too loud when trying to override exterior noises, like on a bus or around other’s loud speech. This could result in tinnitus. However they are terrific for listening to things at low-volume without disturbing others, in bed, while they are on phone, etc. Voice to speech text does not work well with this, and background noises are amplified for persons receiving your phone call. This being said the value for money and comfort is hard to beat. It does not have a volume adjustment on the headset, but this can be completed by pushing them further forward from the years to reduce sound or slid back closer to the year to make the volume louder.  These seem very sturdy, long battery life. I have a small head and sensitive este, these don’t hurt me, very comfortable, leaves enough room behind my head to insert a forefinger yet ride well during activity.  I can also wear sunglasses with them, or one earpiece for two way radio and still get good benefit from the headphones."
Happy Customer!!! Happy Kitties!!!,Update - we decided to add a backdrop to the cat wall. We ordered a no glue mural on Amazon. I absolutely love it. Can you see the cat shelves on the wall? Can you see the cats?  Mission accomplished.
Solid case,This is a very well made case. It feels tough enough to withstand accidental drops but not too rugged to comfortably hold . I love that they give you additional glass screen protectors and rear camera protector.
Almost perfect but needs a hanging hook,This is such a great teaching tool. It is perfect in every way except that it needs a hook for hanging. Seems like you can only hang it on a nail.
Great fit but hot,Hot fabric but great fit
Control you garage with your phone!,"Great WiFi controller so far. Super easy install. Lots of provided options for install but I only needed a few screws. Works great so far, will probably buy another one for the main garage."
Poor mounting rubber.,Fell apart on the first ride!!!
Well made,Fit perfectly. Nice feel to the material.
Size down if you want a snug fit,"I’m 5’2, 125lb and wear a size 2, about a 27in waist. I usually get a medium in tight workout shorts but they swallowed me. I exchanged for a small and it was much better but I think the XS would fit me perfectly. If you like a more snug fit, definitely size down. Now that I have the right size I really like these and will be ordering more. Buttery soft, comfortable and super high waisted."
I wanted denim and it wasn’t,Fit fine but wasn’t what I thought. I thought it was denim and it’s not
Nice phone case at good price,Nice product at fair price
Good size and price,Liked the design  size and price. Have not had it long enough to have tovclean it
It is very very quiet,This machine is so quiet I love that about it. It is also compact so didn’t take a lot of room in my night stand. I also like the blue it makes it look refreshing. A very nice mist comes out and feels clean.
Amazing!,This was amazing!
Simmer up and down perfectly,"Very compact and lightweight. Sturdy construction. Work flawless. Replacement parts (rubber seals, etc) are easy available."
Measure so you get the right size,This would be great as far as comfort if I got the right size
Highly recommend!,"Easy built, really sturdy, bang for your buck!"
"Great Product, terrible handling !","I buy this product from Amazon on a regular basis and really enjoy it.  This time around, when I opened the the plastic package, this is what I found.  The box was torn apart and worse, a number of chocolate bars were cracked or broken to pieces.  I understand, Amazon has little or no control of products after shipment, but I just had to vent this time.  Sorry Amazon !  Erik M."
Best purchase ever,"I bought this for my ceramics/pottery class so I could have more tools to work with and I absolutely don’t regret it! I only had one tool break with me using them everyday for the whole year. It was my fault though because I probably wasn’t using it the way it was intended for, but oh well."
Great product,The fan puts put an excellent stream of air and is nice and quiet. Very easy to assemble. I love it! Highy recommended.
"wow, so good","I've used other toys of this type, but this one is the best by far. The rotating and movement feels fantastic, and the moan sounds are very helpful. i love the different modes and the charge lasts over several uses, so you can use it a lot before you need to charge it again, provided you clean it between uses."
Nice product,"Well executed brass construction, Quality product."
not all there,i will never order from you again i was suppose to get a small bowl and a spoon with the steamer but all i got was the steamer will never order from you again
Not worth it,Not crazy about this model/brand. I’ve bought 5 different ones now seeking a good one and this one is hard to keep the attachments on and they fall off while using.
So cute,"Super cute and fluffy. Got these for my daughter and she loves them! They are a bit big for her but that’s fine, since the design goes around your whole foot no need for it to fit."
Small and works well,"Love the small size, the light. Purchased a different one as well as this to have a less expensive vacuum on my second floor. So far so good. Like that is small, has a mount, adjustable as well. Hopefully will last."
Investment,Exactly as described
"Tough plastic, durable.","Have used twice to transport a mattress, once strapped tightly on top of my Forester. Still in good shape for next move."
BROKEN x2,"How disappointing. I liked the style of these, easy order, quick shipping, but they dishes arrived damaged. I quickly returned, nice and easy, only to receive a 2nd set chipped/damaged. Returned again. Unacceptable."
Good,Great product at a great price. Buy it and you’ll be glad you did! Makes a great gift too.
Beautiful!!,I absolutely love this snow globe.  It comes on automatically each evening and works perfectly.  Just love it.
Poor shipping guidelines,"Other than the fact that one of the nightgowns was literally: thrown into the bag it was shipped as it was extremely wrinkled, item was fine."
Great selection of colors.,The bands are colorful and a little stiff.  Improve with wear and time (flexibility of the bands).
Beautiful,These are very beautiful in the garden
easy to install and cheap price~,It got the right amount of padding on it and lightweight. Spent me only 5 mins to install. I'm happy with the purchase!
Durable and fun.,This product is exactly as expected. My grandson loves Imaginext and I was happy to add to his collection. It is easy to play with and fun.
my daughter loves it!,just as described and expected. faster than expected shipping.
i just love it so muchs,good for your money
Cable is Very Thick,"Does the jo.  I should have considered the dimensions a bit more carefully.  The cable is rather unwieldy.  But if you need it to stay in place, this might be the one for you."
Received scuffed shoes,Shoes have been worn
Still eats poo,I have 3 rescue dogs 15 to 25 pounds and give them two  per day but still can't get 2 of them to stop eating poo. They love these no poo treats but still eat most of the poo. I have tried other brands and two jars of this brand but will not be buying any more.
Face is smooth & is clearing,I use my steamer at least twice a week & I see a noticeable difference. Highly recommended.
doesn't work,"stopped working after 5 days, I don't have time to return it, I bought an other brand"
Good robe fits a bit smaller than expected,I purchased two robes of similar style in the same size and one was a tad too small and one a tad too big.  Its probably due to  the of the overseas manufacturing (China?)
Great cream,"I just love this cream. It works 100% on any cut, scratch, bruise. It’s truly a good antibiotic. It covers wounds and cuts in a short period of time. It is my first choice over the counter. Thank you for delivering this cream so fast. Thank you."
Extremely comfortable,"Most comfortable undies I have worn in ages.  Doesn’t ride up, doesn’t bind., plenty  of crotch space. Lots of flattering colors too."
Awesome,Great purchase
Good,Good
"It protects my phone, is easy to grip, and it doesn't fade.",I've had this case for 3 months and it still looks new and has protected my phone from a few unexpected DROPS to the ground. I love the purple and it wipes clean with just a damp cloth. If I ever get tired of this color I will definetly order another one of the many colors it comes in.
I love this.,So soft and perfect thickness
Great!,Exactly what I expected.  This will be super handy for my art projects.
Easy to use,My kids are liking it very much. This is very large inflatable pool. Very easy to use and good quality of it.  It takes a few seconds to inflate.
Good,Great product
Good size for an iPad,Perfect size for an iPad and a few other things.
Product was delivered on time but didn't come with the Rechargeable battery.,Product would probably work fine I had to go buy AA batteries because the Rechargeable battery didn't come with the product but the charging cable did.
N/,N/A
Not so good,It doesn’t even kill the bugs.  I had to spray everyday for more then one week to get rid from Cockroaches
Good not great,"The look is cute and it is fairly comfortable,  but the watch face is a bit too heavy for it to feel secure.  I am constantly fighting to keep it in place on my wrist."
Nice light weight men’s flannel robe,"Purchased for my Dad and he loves it- soft, light weight flannel that is nice and warm"
Best jacket,"This is my favorite jacket this far,  stylish and actually warm"
"great size, not too big or too little","Love that it is two tone gold and silver, it is a great size, too. I have a small face and some of the coins are just too big  by the time you add a decent frame."
IMPRESSED,"I was skeptical about buying something like this from Amazon, but I am highly highly impressed with this product!! It is so easy to use and is great quality!! I have done my finger nails, toenails, and have done my sisters as well!! I would recommend this to anyone who wants to save the money and do their own nails from home, you won’t regret it!"
easy,it was easy to use
Too much spring.,"It’s too difficult to have good control over the pups, as there’s too much give on both leash sections."
Perfect from the box.,Easy setup out of the box. I am not a drone expert at all and was able to fly in 10 min.
Lots of fun for kids,So many stickers  :) they help me to keep may little girls busy when i needed:)
For beginners,For beginners
Yes,Yes
"It will keep your pants up. That's what you want, right?","Love that it's cut-to-fit. Very sturdy, and keeps my pants up when I'm carrying. That's the important part. And I have a chronic case of noassatall. Can carry a P80 in a belt loop OWB kydex without flashing a vertical smile. Very metal. ????"
Great product and great customer service,Bought the wrong size but they sent me the right one quickly. Vivid color on the collar and it seems durable. Thank you!
Very comfortable,"I really liked the product true to size very comfortable, worth of price better than paying $60 This product is worth off $100 , recommend"
Perfect compact wallet,Awesome design!
"Sorry, not nearly as good as advertised.","I would have returned it, if it hadn't been so inexpensive, and I destroyed packaging too soon."
My puppy chews everything but this,Maybe this bone is great for some dogs but my teething puppy never picked this up.
Very small,Very small
Great looking and comfortable too,"The socks are made well, fit perfect and look good. Just the right amount of elastic so the don’t fall down yet not bind."
It’s okay,"It’s not thick enough, everything popped when cooked"
Loo,Little smaller than i thought.
Lightweight,So worth to buy it with my bike.
Very confortable.,"This is by far the best muzzle I’ve ever try on my dog. She was able to drink water while using it, and I was able to to even gave her treats with the muzzle on for training."
Do NOT buy this controller,This controller was only used TWICE in short sessions before we realized the LB button didn't work. Over $100 wasted on this trash defective controller.
Not for children under 6,I would not recommend for children under 6. I purchased this for my nephew and the food pieces are to small.
Cute and the right size,SO cute and don’t make my ears itch. Weren’t hard to get in.
Broke n cheap,Arrived broken.
Great!!!,Got the timer for work because we needed something that wouldn’t just fall off the oven and this timer is perfect. I wish it were a little louder but it does the job for sure.
GREAT FIT,These fit perfect in my ford ranger. The color was exactly as described and easy to put on.
High hopes,It was fine until the top broke and I was able to spray at all. Only hot a few uses out if it. Never had that happen to me before.
Super cool for a month,"I loved this product for the first few weeks, it gradually got dimmer every time it turned on. It’s barely on now"
Great Soap Dispenser,"I love this soap dispenser.  It makes washing hands so much more sanitary and safe. It is easy to use and refill, an all around great product."
Love this blanket,I like everything about this blanket
Wrong size,Was sent the wrong size
Unexpected,"This ramen was absolutely DELICIOUS!! The spice is definitely there, but I’m sorry in my opinion it was NOT the spiciest ramen in the world. BUT the flavor is the best taste you will have! My god it is so good. I wish I took pictures, but when I thought of it, the bowl was already gone. Would definitely recommend this to anyone. Still a great experience,  but everyone is different so if you’re not into spicy then you should still be cautious because of some people this will be VERY spicy. Enjoy!"
Precio y calidad,"Muy económico y práctico. Me adelanta el trabajo, pues siempre tengo un reemplazo con el cable."
"These are all off, none of the butterflies are cut right",15 bucks and a container of garbage bad cuts that look like junk and it says not returnable. Trash they are just trash
Comfy,So soft and comfy
Awesome,Amazing hands down
overpriced,"overpriced, cannot believe I paid almost 7 dollars fro 2 oz of seed.  1 1/2 meager pickings and had to pull them up."
"Excellent Steam Mop, Easy to Use","We bought this mop after something oil based got on our tiled kitchen floor while we were moving and we were having trouble cleaning it. We found this steam mop, ordered it & it arrived quickly and did the trick. The floor looked great & it did not take a lot of time. It is lightweight & very easy to use.  Compact, so uses minimal storage space. We were very pleased with the job it did & thrilled it reduced the time we spent getting our house ready to sell. I would definitely recommend this product."
Just like my old magpul,Great quality. I'm a long time user of magpul cases and this one is identical.
Love it,Works great with my echo show 8
Fit and comfort,I returned these. They were too big and they just were stiff and not comfortable.
OMG GET JT NOW,I WAS NERVOUS ABOUT THE SWEATER TURNING OUT TO BE LOW QUALITY BUT ITS WAY BETTER THEN THOSE $50 SWEATERS AT TRAGET! ITS SO COMFY AND SOFT AND LIGHT! IM 5’7 AND I GOT A TIMES LARGE SWEATER! AGAIN $15 FOR THIS CHEAP SWEATER THATS SO GOOD QUALITY OMG I DEFR RECOMMEND. And that wasn’t first fast typing response
Size is just right,Great little leash for my little ????
Great product,Used for covering thanksgiving turkey.  It worked great.
grinder foot switch,instant off & on
X-cell ant!,Great figures!
Pet pleasing,My kitty purrs when you use it!
My cat LOVES this!,"My cats LOVE chasing the little chopper discs!  So much fun!  And if they bring them back to you like one of mine does, you don't even have to get up, the fun continues!"
It’s a really good temporary PPF,It was my first time trying track armour on my car and it was a lot easier to deal with than masking tape. Tape is thick enough where i dont need to add a second layer. Really worked well for me after 1 full trackday. Taking the tape off was as easy as removing plastic coverings on a brand new stuff.
This is my second and pleased,Needed a extra one. Highly recommended.
Great Purchase,It is Very sturdy
Beautiful,This is a cute little clear decorative case that I bought for my new Iphone 12 Pro Max.
No scent is a good scent ��,I appreciate the natural scent of the ingredients instead of masking them with something unappealing. It didn’t work for what I was hoping for but that’s unrealistic and overall it’s a good product.
Colors,The reviews are great and the colors people have bought look greats I do not recommend the green as you can see the sleeve is way way darker and doesn’t look right. I tried it on hoping it would look better but nope. Going to return and maybe try a different color.
Multi use,Okay haven’t actually used it... for its intended purpose. I just like bouncing on it while watching TV at the moment.  It’s actually a good physical therapy tool? But great quality. Love it. Thanks!
DISAPPOINTED. Hot to hold and cracked after 3 months,"The feel and look of this is great and I wanted to love it. I bought for my husband for Christmas and he doesn’t use it because it’s so hot to hold, which also means it’s not keeping in the heat. It says it’s dishwasher safe but I never put it in the dishwasher and after 3 months the inside cracked."
missing items and broken package,The box itself came completely demolished and there was only one sword in it. The sword itself was fine but I can't cosplay with just one of them
Perfect funny mug!,"Love this mug! This made my son laugh when I gave it to him, kids have less social lives now so gives them a chuckle! Great quality and perfect for tea for my college boy!"
Newborn,This is a cute outfit and he looked handsome
Works as expected,Works as expected. Excellent warmth And comfort
The carbon fiber is a sticker!,The carbon fiber Lexus license plate covers sold by Tuesnut are very cheap and the carbon fiber is a sticker that peels off almost immediately.  Once it owes off you are left with a blank metal cover.  Total garbage.
Don’t waste your money,Garbage returned it ....never worked
Product works great for my grand puppies,Love the product just wish they sold larger bottle .
Sturdiness,The size of the dinner plate is generous. .
Great!,These are great!
Quality chairs,We are very happy with these chairs. Easy to put together. They seem like they are made well and  good quality.
Great price and perfect color for me.,I appreciate being able to buy an Estee Lauder product in a small size for two reasons - I can try it out without spending a fortune - It fits nicely in my makeup bag in my small purse. I have purchased this small one twice. I even bought one for my niece. Thanks
Nice design... durable and versatile,Well sized. Strong construction. Larger one can be used for crafting with tongue depresser sticks and scissors fitting nicely.
Product NOT perfect,Quick delivery.  The electronic switch works as it should. The spring catch of the body is misaligned causing the door to pop open and stop the wash cycle.  Be cautious with this distributor.
"Sturdy, easy to assemble potty chair",I bought this for my 3 year old. She was so excited to get to use the big potty. The chair is very easy to assemble and very sturdy. I am pleased with the seat cushion it is soft and not hard plastic. My daughter loves that their are handles for her to hold to feel more comfortable. I definitely recommend for any parent potty training their little one/ones.
Great Scent,The scent was great!
Vibrant colors.,I've used them for outdoor cushion seats. Added a lot of spark to my garden.
Great product,The ability to charge my phone while on the stand.
Spend more money,Three are off from the other's. None are the same and one wouldn't even come on. Of course
Nice,Not as shiny as it looks on website. But it has a nice vintage look. Looks like it cost way more than it does. (Ignore the blue ting in my photo it is reflecting something in the room.)
Swims like a motorboat,My Arthritic dog spends more time floating and chasing balls. I don't have to worry. Fit is fab and easily adjustable.
"Great compression sleeves, for winter","I use them as compression sleeves after my vein procedure. They are great for that purpose. Thick, elastic, comfortable, and good looking design patterns. Don’t think they’ll stay on if you are running or doing other exercises. They are too thick for summer but great for winter."
Great product,Look forward to using this product  has a great scent! Will be posting a follow up very soon!
Good magnet product as described,Good magnet product as described
Excellent affordable rangefinder watch,Easy to use and has only the features I want to use.  I highly recommend.
Best Sheets Ever,Been sleeping on them for a few months and they get softer after every wash. Cannot imagine buying any other brand again.
Rip off it says height 7 inches barely 3 inches very unhappy,Wow this is a rip-off it said seven inches barely 3 inches it's so tiny you can't even use it for display very unhappy with this purchase not worth the value and not worth gifting
Price,"Great product, awesome price. Purchased another set for my daughter."
So bright,It's ok ????
Check rear mount alignment before you scratch your fender,"It is a simple install, but I had to bend the rear mount to match the contour of the fender, which in turn cracked the paint. For $20, it will hold my bag from rubbing in my fender. It’s worth the money"
Finally Clean Glasses!,"Great product and great value. Cleans well, doesn't streak, and has no scent. And the cleaning clothes that are included are great also."
Great buy !,"Hair Quality is great , little to no shedding . I’ve had it for 2 months and wear it literally everyday . I got 20 inch because 24 was sold out but I will be buying it . The 20 inch length is good but I would prefer longer . It’s kinda thin but looks natural"
Easy,Easy Assembly
The update ruined the utilization,"We love the fire stick but with the recent update to the new format has ruined the ease of finding what you use. Having tiny icons of your most used apps is worthless. It now looks like our Samsung tv menu, which we hated, which it why we installed the fire stick. Super annoyed!"
Wouldn’t buy again,A little small no padding
Book shelf,Love the color of shelves super cute fits mini or small books only
Good,Good
If you want control of light this is it,Small precise hair light
Read This First,"This little lamp is beautiful. The only reason I'm removing a star is because the directions are incomplete and unclear, which led to frustration and wasted time. (You must tap the electrical port to change the brightness and color, after it has charged.) This will make a great gift for a hard-to-buy-for relative."
"Not too thick, not too thin",Like the colors and they are the right thickness to get my shoes on.
Ecco are great shoes,I used to wear Cole Haan shoes but about 6 years ago they stopped making the nike airs so I bought a pair of Ecco . So much better quality shoes the leather is thicker . The shoes are more comfortable . I have bought 3 pair since and all 4 pair are still holding up great and I walk over 10k steps a day .
Finally ... relief!,Extremely happy with this. Just the right amount of support for me. I bought two more!
A must have.,I use it for much more than celery and it's great. I bought it because of Medical Medium :)
Great for price,Great socks
0,No
5/10 Stability and 3/10 for Fishing,"I don’t believe this product should be advertised as a fishing kayak, as shown in the photographs provided. The stability of this kayak is also less than I expected when trying to fish off the side of it. Despite this the kayak does seem durable, fits in the trunk of a coupé with room to spare, was shipped quickly and with all the advertised pieces. Just aware that the warranty is not active for amazon purchases. I’ve decided to purchase the 285FPB from their official website, as it was advertised as strictly a fishing device."
They save time and wasted potatoes,Peel potatoes
Good system,It’s a great system. Plays well. And the graphics are amazing. It’s a PlayStation. It sells itself
works great - great color,love these colors - need to find larger bottles!!!
Worked great for road trip,It was easy to install and worked great for the family road trip.
Olive Oil?,This product is just olive oil with calendula flowers added. Who knows how much calendula
Stick with what you know.,The blade doesn't cut well at all. It is not smooth and vibrates I had to take it off the saw after a few cuts. I have 4 other saws and have used these type of saws for years that is concrete / demo saws.
Cute Cute Cute,Very Cute!  Fast shipping
Artfully crafted cobalt drinking glasses,"I am thrilled with my purchase! Perfect size, thickness, weight, and beautiful cobalt color. I for sure will order more from NOVICA. Definitely worth the wait, all the way from Mexico! Quality shipping packaging."
Good quality,"True to fit for the most part, the hip area of the pants are a little big on me but i love the color and quality"
Awesome for book shelves & tea shelf,Small but very strong and sturdy. I know they’ll hold up these bookshelves perfectly.
Great product.  Holds our 100+ pound part "sled dog" back,Product works great.  Freed my hands when I'm hiking so I can use my hiking poles.
Bit by rip-off shark,"poor craftsmanship, amateur paint, non-realistic characterization, not fit for a 2-year old or older."
Super easy.,Everything you need for an oil change except an oil filter wrench
Best cup warmer ever,So far everything is great!
Not breathable,"I suppose I should have been more suspicious about a mattress cover that claimed to be both breathable and water-proof. The inside of it is lined with some sort of plastic or rubber, which may be waterproof, but is not breathable. You can test this yourself, put it against your lips and blow. No air passes through. There's a softer fabric over the top, but that's not going to provide any sort of air flow. If you have a mattress that's supposed to be breathable or have a cooling effect, a sheet of plastic between you and it pretty much nullifies the effect."
Good,Working
Nice Product,Worth it.. because of nice features like monitoring energy.. I am using for morning breakfast egg boiler.. scheduling is super nice. very happy with purchase
Love it,My kids love it. It helps them organize their dolls and accessories
Loooooves it!,Gave as a Christmas gift and the giftee can’t stop praising it. The pic is clear and the size is huge.
Es hermoso!!!,"Leí los comentarios y note que las tallas no eran exactas, fui precavida y compré una talla menos, le va quedar perfecto!!! Es hermoso, excelente calidad �"
colors don't match,Seems too thick and doesn't match skin.  The colors look different than shown and very hard to find one to match skin.
They fit.,"The undies are soft, stretchy and comfortable."
Works well,"this works great, very slim design and intuitive. All charging ports/stations work well, I like that you can just use the single charging station for the phone and separate the iWatch and AirPod. Perfect for office or in home."
Hurry up to purchase!,Best phone of 2020
Bad,Did not last after first wash
The best stylus I’ve ever purchased.,"This stylus is the best stylus I’ve ever purchased. The fiber tip is soft and easy to use. The clear disk tip—well i didn’t think at first it would work as well as a regular point rip, but it does and even better then my other tip stylus’s."
Most comfortable pillows for the price,Had these for 2 months and they're still very comfortable.  I really like them. For me these are the  best pillows to sleep on.
Sharp sturdy knife set,"Seemingly great set of knives, comfortable in your hand, extremely sharp."
Just what I needed,Perfect for home and travel.
good value,does what its supposed to do
Great robot vacuum for a great price,Great vacuum for a great price. This is the first robot vacuum we have purchased. It is simple to operate and is great for picking up the daily dust and and hair they the week to keep things looking good and has helped cut back on use of our upright corded vacuum.
Superb Quality,Fits exactly how I imagined. Quality of material is amazing and soft. Will definitely purchase again
good  product,great price
Don’t work.,These doesn’t work. Don’t stick to face nor does it do anything to the bumps. Also isn’t sheer and you can tell their on your face.
Fast shipping,Came pretty fast good quality filter
Very short draw string,"While I do like the pattern, they are on the smaller side and the draw string is way to short. I ordered a XXL and the string to tighten the shorts should of been 59"" for that size. As it was, I measured mine at 55"" and couldn't even tie a bow this when you put the shorts on, the string pulls inside the string hole this making it very difficult to pull back out. That's a key component this why I knocked 3 stars off. Had to buy 2 64"" draw strings at $12 just to be able to tie an appropriate not so pants stay up."
Good value,Cost Effective and good quality.
Worth the Money,This vacuum is excellent and very lite and easy to use.  The product is well designed. My wife loves your vacuum. I will never repurchase another expensive vacuum.
"Sturdy, great quality, easy to use!",It really works for spinal decompression. My chiropractor has it in his office and lets me use it after my therapy session. I watch the cooking shows or news while inverted!  Ie love it so much that I ended buying one for my house! I use it before and after martial arts class and it helps to open up your chest and expand your lungs.  Very helpful
Beautiful and high quality shelves!,"Easy to install, easy instructions. Quick delivery. BEAUTIFUL shelves, Love them! The wood is very pretty and the quality is superb."
Mini Air Cooler,"This small fan is good for your personal space like your desk or next to your bed. It uses water to cool down and moisten the air it blows, so it works best when the air is dry, which also helped me when I had the heater on recently. It does its job quietly, which I appreciate because I like to have it running during the night also. Overall it is exactly what I expected and does what I want from it."
Positive saying,I love affirmations that are positive so every morning when I look in my mirror I get to see that
Pretty and lightweight; thin but sturdy.,"Overall I really like these planters!  Very lightweight but sturdy enough to hold decor.  Only problem I had was one of the planters was bent in at the bottom (zoom in on the bottom of left planter). Not worth returning to me, it'll add to that ""rustic"" look lol."
Amazing frother,"I love how it heats up and froths so well. I tend to use less milk with this. Non dairy creamer varies in the ability to froth-oat milk tends to froth very little, but cow/cream and nut milk froths better."
Great!!!,Great controls for an affordable price
Must have for gamers,Very easy to use and set up. I used this to connect my Nintendo switch and xbox and now I can add more things. The remote is great so you don’t have to keep clicking a button on the actual device like others.
Perfect!,Perfect!
Must get camera,"I just got into video making....I’m not disappointed one bit. This camera is AWESOME!!! The features are awesome, although I’m still learning how to use them. It has the image stabilization is on point for something that fits in a shirt pocket. I’m looking forward to getting my hands on another one to add another video angle."
Good product.,No complaints. The logo can no placed towards the back if you dislike it. But I have no complaints.
They still run small,Still a little small
Quality Case and Great Service,"Second time of ordering these for storing my valuable prescription sunglasses.  Virtually crushproof.  Just the right size, not too big but they hold my Oakley sunglasses.  Great ervice from Splaqua."
Perfect,Perfect replacement for Starbucks tumblers
We Needed More Memory than 8 gig,"We had an 8 gig SD Card that was not enough, so we ordered this 32 gig. We have had it for a couple of weeks. We turned off  the phone, took out the battery, replaced the SD card, plugged in the battery, turned on the phone. We took a pictures, used the phone. Everything seemed to work as before. I looked at the storage. There are 29.xx gigs still available on the SD. Everything seems to work well. It is nice to have some available memory on my phone again. When we find my wife's phone we will order another one."
Thanks,Good price
Awesome,It has so many zippers and it was perfect to transport our Pomeranian in to the Vets.
Very very leaky,"I love the color , it’s beautiful, but the stains and leaking it’s horrible . I washed it three times and still comes color out of it like it’s not going away . I stained the sink , bathtub , my hands and face , very messy , so for me the leaking and mess it’s not worth ."
Work great for a DIY car maintenance,These adapters work great for taking off lug nuts and various other bolts when working on the car. It is a simple device but very handy to adapt to various socket sizes. Very good for DIY car mechanic. So far I had no issues with any of the sockets that I used.
They stretch and feel good,I love the socks.  They make my legs and feet feel good.  Will buy again.
Lightweight and efficient!,"Amazing vaccum for the price! Makes getting pet hair up so easy! Turns, gets under couches, in corners. One of the best Amazon buys I’ve ever made!"
BluFire Security Alarm,I recently bought this product. Thought I liked it cause I never had an issue! I installed on my 2020 Yamaha YZF-R6 and I killed my battery. Know i have to purchase a battery for $103. Honestly isn't worth the $40 if your gonna end up having to buy a new battery.
Top shelf airbrush,Great airbrush great quality nice price highly recommend
Best radio clock,Durable! Love this radio clock!
Perfect,These are the best brushes for chalk paint!
Its the best mini aquarium pump on the market,This lil pump rocks! Its very quiet and does an excellent job �
Great Scrub Pants,"Great scrub pants. I’m an ER RN. The scrubs get a good work out for many shifts during their lifetime. ( last about 2 years)..1 wash a week. They fit really well, there’s plenty of room in them, and they’re very colorfast in the wash. They have cargo pockets on each leg, regular front pockets, and a pocket on the back for your wallet with a button on it. I love the design. It’s the only one I will buy now. Would buy them again. Thank you."
Value,Good fit and great value.
Don’t buy,There is no grey tint looks white
Works and tested as 2.4 Gbps,"Didn't see the specs anywhere on the product page (said something about 1.3 mbps..?) , but it was cheaper than other cables and the reviews said it just works, so I took the risk. The bag it came in said it was USB 3.2 gen 1 and the Oculus desktop app test results said 2.4 gbps so I'm happy."
Impressive can and you don’t have to worry about The lid smacking into your counter,"Impressive can, and you don’t have to worry about the lid smacking into your countertop as our old one did, the only downside to this can is that it is a little bit short for me, as I am a 6 foot tall person and when I reach down full extension of my arm I still have to bend down another four or 5 inches to trigger the Cans sensor and I do have a pretty long arms, so if they can was four or 5 inches taller I think it would be a little bit of an improvement. Not a fault of the can just for me it would be ideal if it was a few inches taller maybe a slightly higher base or something?"
Me encantó,Me dejo el cabello con su primera lavada súper bien y con más cabello me siento.
Universal remote control,Very helpful
Theres better out there,Dosen't hold the paper as well as other I've had
I want more! One in each color!,Well made. Great design. Fit just right.
Good  warmth & bright headlight feature,"Gave to my brother for a birthday gift and he loves it!  In addition to keeping his head thus his body warm, he really likes the headlight feature.  It's a really bright light since most of his walking is done during the evening hrs."
Made in China,A nice card attached to the $350 Woodstock Chime telling the story of how a poor musician got started making chimes. Today the tag reads “ Made in China”. Apparently he’s made so much money he couldn’t care less about making chimes anymore and offshores them to China. Sad!!!
Great prices,A+
Not a direct replacement for stock Danner insoles,these insoles are a bit thicker than the ones that came with my boots. They made my boot tight which is understandable but I didn't expect it. I also felt as though they are not as comfortable. I put them in my rubber concrete boots and they did improve the comfort of those.
They are beautiful and we love them!,We love them!
great desk mount mic stand,"Super awesome mic stand- essential for daily video calls, podcasting, etc .... what a durable and awesome looking mic stand.  If you have a great mic and need a desk stand, this is exactly what you want!"
Very good!,"Very good for my raspberry pi 0 w, the screen is awesome! clear view, just that's a little small, but the stand has great value!"
Worked wonders for my spraned ankle.,I had broken a small bone on the top of my foot when the tendon snapped up. Also tore a ligament on the side of the ankle. Was in a boot for two months and the swelling and pain continued. This stopped the severe swelling in my ankle and foot I had been having for over two months. The healing process seemed to speed up after wearing this each day. Happy I bought this.
It's all happening,"Got unit today, works perfectly. I initially used my Zone 2 out rca connectors, but not all sources routed out. Instead, I am using the headphone adapter into the 1/8th"" input. It would have been helpful if they had a 1/4"" headphone adapter but it's 2021 and I had one in my electronic archives. (we all have those boxes don't we?). Anyway, latency and quality was similar with HD or LL switch so not sure what the big deal is with that - sounds great. Good headroom, and can use volume on receiver to set level. Watched 30 min of Almost Famous and it never cut out. I got them so I could use the treadmill and watch movies without blasting the house away. perfect."
Quality,"Fits great, comfortable and definitely a great value for the money! I ordered two more pair and will continue to order in the future."
Worth the money,"Fits well, overall a great accessory"
Finally—organized batteries,"The ZesGood-battery box finally offered me a means of organizing our household batteries. The case easily stands on our shelf. Inside the case are multiple foam spots for inserting batteries of various sizes. Because we had so many AA batteries, we could even use the AAA spots to insert the AA’s.  The foam design is the key to making this battery organizer genius. I also like the zip pocket on the inside cover that allows me to store the battery tester (comes with bag) along with a plethora of flat, button types of batteries."
Perfect toddler water bottle,"Easy to use and clean, very durable and keeps ice almost all day. My toddler loves it so much we had to buy a second!"
Great for after surgery patients!,My wife had a knee replacement and this raised seat made it so much easier for her. You can only bend so far after that surgery and with the raised seat she sit down with little pain! I would recommend this seat! Very easy to install!
Never going back to other soap products!,First time trying this body wash and I AM IN LOVE! Smells good and it's thick and creamy so it goes a long way in the shower! Also does NOT leave a weird residue on your skin like some other soaps/bodywashes do.  :) :) :)
Excellent Sea Salt Packaged in Convenient Cardboard Containers,"The Morton All Purpose Sea Salt is a good quality salt to season all your favorite dishes with.  The salt is pretty much preground sea salt with no iodide.  It’s flavor is sound, the ground is fairly uniform, and the container is perfect for bringing to picnics and family gatherings as it’s disposable.  If you absolutely hate the look of the container, it’s easy enough to pour the salt into a prettier dispenser using the large opening at the top of the container, and each 4.4 ounce container is about the right size for fill most salt dispensers.  With 12 containers of salt per pack, you’ll have plenty of salt to season all your entrees."
Great Buy,Hats are cute.  Big variety and colors.  Easy to wear.
Portable USB,Great light!
Good Deal,Great for short or long runs. Helps with muscle discomfort and warmth when it’s cold
Works just fine,It works like expected
Buy This Coat!,Ordered this jacket in 2 colors and I LOVE them!
"Great value, recommend",Quick ship. As described. Value for money. Installation was tricky but used a youtube tutorial. Took 2 people and about 1 hour.
Fun in the sun,"This is a great set for kids to take to the beach. I bought one for my son and daughter. They really liked playing with them. The only thing I wish they would’ve done when making it would be to make the top lock into place to secure the toys, not a deal breaker though."
Love my hair,Very soft no smell and very pretty I get complimented everywhere only been installed two days but very promising I’ve ordered hair from UNice and this is very good n quality like theirs . Please make hd closures
Chipping off,My nails only lasted 4 days. They started chipping after 2 days.
Easy to use,????
Helped with my dogs fur,This is the third bottle I bought for my pups.
Colorful,These were a huge hit at my daughters birthday party.  My kids 6 & 4 still play with them.
Great towel.,Love this towel. Price was right for two. Use them at the pool everyday. Will be ordering a few more.
Unusable!,"They were not universal. Did not fit in my base! I needed six so I had to order eight, total waste of money."
NOT COMPATIBLE WITH HEADPHONES,"The controller itself is actually better quality than a ps4 controller but when I plug in the headphones I can hear everything but the mic won't pick up sound. I know it's not my headphones because it works fine with the other controllers just now this one, I mostly play while talking so I am going to return this. I'm really disappointed."
Light review,"Easy to use,"
Awesome saw,Spot on description
Unfortunate,One of the motors inside the fan wasn’t properly popped into place.  I had to disassemble the fan in order to pop the motor into place.
Not recommended,"This razor us awful. The blades barely touch the skin. The soap builds up after one swipe thus you're rinsing under string water pressure. The installation of the blade is bit as simple as the standard blades not to mention these are nothing like the standard blades, so you can't use any other handle. I will not purchase these again."
waste of money,it is a joke and a waste of money. It is that bad and would not recommend.
Magical,"Its just perfect…. I absolutely love it, great quality, perfect size, and the color it’s so warm… very beautiful. I definitely recommend it."
Expensive but I Love Stasher Bags,High quality product.  I wish it were less expensive.
Bakery,Son super excelentes me encantan al 100%
Highly recommend,Got so many compliments on it. Very simple yet industrial. Love it.
Perfect high heels,Comfortable high heels! You can wear at work and your foot won’t get tired ! Recommend it !
My dog loves it!,My Frenchie loves the bed!!
Love this,I stuck this to my bathroom mirror too the left of the faucet.  I put it about 8" above the counter so it doesn't get wet when people wash their hands.  Great for company because no one likes using a wet towel that is in the bathroom that everyone else uses.  Especially these days!!  Less way of getting bacteria!!
Too big and material is a little cheap.,Too big
Works great!,Great value! Arrived quickly. Works great!
"Great, and...",I bought two of these solar flashlights chargers because I liked the way they performed. But both of them didn't last a year.
Great gift,This toy is durable! It stands up to vigorous toddler play! Adults love it too!
A+,"Very nice beach blanket! Fast shipping, highly recommend."
Cheap table. Defective parts that they refused to replace. They told me to drill the holes myself.,The white faux marble is less than an inch thick and looks really cheap. The legs had the holes on the wrong side so I couldn't complete assembly. The bottom bar that connects stabilizes the table and because the holes where on the wrong side I couldn't install that bar causing the table to be uneven and unstable. I messaged the seller twice and they told me to drill the holes myself and that they couldn't send me correct replacement legs. I'm really disappointed. SAVE YOUR MONEY
Great buy,Love it
The most uncomfortable unstable junk,It is a very small seated surface and not comfortable the whole stool wobbles and slides on the ground. Not worth the money and not practical. Yes i am returning it
Great press!,Love my press! Everything I needed!
It’s too difficult to open,When trying to open and put my phone in I have to use both hands to open it.
Needing more practice,I'm excited with my purchase but gonna need more practice to get the look i want. It takes longer to do my nails this way but the ones that i get right do look good. I'll keep on practicing.
Return your device if defective.,"I dislike how the laptop I purchased is defective, and delivered without the battery."
The best webcam,The camera captures certainly good quality feed.
Show box,I love it
Glad to have it again.,"I’ve always used good seasons, my favorite. When I needed a new cruet after many years, I noticed my store no longer carried it so I found it online. So happy to have it again."
This is a very good hose,"I've always been skeptical of hoses like this but this has worked great so far. It has great reach, is very light weight and so far I didn't have any problems with leaks even with a toddler stepping on it constantly."
"Pretty blouse, wished I had ordered a size smaller","Very pretty blouse, flowing, light weight, flattering, but I wish I had ordered a medium. There is a charge to return, so I will keep and see if I can shrink polyester. For reference I am 5'7"" 169 lbs. and purchased a large, but a medium would have fit better."
Perfect,A very good fit. I like it>
Fake! Not original product!!!,These are knockoffs! Not original. Original are made in USA. These have a foreign language written on them and are made in Vietnam. Returning them.
Good light for the money.,"Purchased these as back up lights for my extra off duty car. Lights work great worth the money, this is the 3 set I’ve had. All three still work and are in use on other vehicles."
Flimsy,Tore when my adult child put it on. Their thumb went right through it.
Very sturdy,COVID-19 vaccination cards fit perfectly.
Nice toothbrushes,"My first electric toothbrush and I love it. My teeth feel almost like I just had a cleaning at the dentist. It’s easy to use, no issues. Great value and I love that it came with lots of extra brushes and travel cases."
Leg day game changer!,These are a game changer for knee comfort during training! They also work well if you pull them down to your lower leg to help cushion the leg extension or seated leg curl pad. And they help protect my shins during deadlifts.
So SOFT!!!,I bought two of these for nieces and nephews.... I’m keeping one and ordering another it’s so cozy!!!
Great deal for the money.,The wallet is good quality. Plenty of slots for cards. Folds nice and slim. Came in a nice looking box.
Can't be beat for its price,Pros
Happy and enjoy �,Satisfied for this product.!
Great Ride!,We bought two of these (one pink and one yellow). Our 5.5 year old and 3.5 year old can both easily drive them and they both drive at speed levels that are not too fast for their age. I would recommend these if you’re looking for a great Power Wheels for your child!
Awesome product. I am very pleased with this purchase.,Versatile sturdy stand that I use for my phone. Very solid product.
Terrific sponge!,Incredibly great sponge...that's something I never would have imagined I'd be saying...but it's the truth!
Great product!,"It took my 14 week old puppy some time to grasp the concept but with time and patience, now she’s a pro! I love that I can hear it even if I’m in the back of the house. She hits it with her paw and so far they have held up. If that changes u will update my review. As of now I’m so happy with this purchase and my pup is too!"
Not what it claims to be,"I ordered the rack to fit my 1 1/4"" hitch.  It's advertised as fitting either that hitch or a 2"" with the included sleeve.  I ordered it in October, didn't unpack it until May (cold winter).  Well, the rack delivered only fits a 2"" hitch, so it's useless for me.  And the return window closed 1-31!"
Facil de armar,Material y fácil de armar
Great for curly hair!,Awesome product for my very curly hair!
Terrible product not made to last more than one day. Avoid .,"Rake broke after 15 minutes of work, with two tines being pulled out of the fastening... a piece of 20 gauge wire threaded through a single hole . Terrible design."
Great Product,"Product did as it stated. I applied it to many starts, and they took off and are still doing well. It is a great value for the price. Would buy again."
Great hose but get the extra warranty,"This hose is lightweight, doesn't kink unless you try really hard and it will flatten out if you drive over it.  We bought 2 fifty footers and one blew out right near the top.  There is an extra protective plastic for the top but it doesn't stay in place and that's where it blew out.  The good news is that the warranty replaced it but only with an Amazon credit and not cash back."
Great stuff!!!,Invigorating and refreshing scent. Nice cooling effect that wakes you up.
Perfect!,Awesome. It cut through the carpet like a hot knife in butter. Definitely would recommend. Shipping was quick. Nicely packaged and a good price. Doesn't feel flimsy of cheap even though the price is affordable.
great mat and I loe it,I think the order was perfect. The mat was great. Thank you.
Absolutely Amazing,"Beautiful, strudy, smooth as floating. Absolutely worth every penny. Donated all other scooter in garage."
Works.,Works well.
easy to build,My 10 year old was able to put this together. Fast shipping. It's not so sturdy but for light things its good.
Love the Quality and Sizes,"It's perfect for what I'm working on, the different sizes gives an optical depth effect on a flat surface, makes it more interesting for the eye"
This is a lovely and comfortable ring.,I love this ring. I have received many compliments. It is very comfortable and true to size. It arrived in a lovely gift box.
Did not work at all,The product did not work at all
Just want I was looking for,"I've been looking for exactly this set! Nice tall grinders, easy adjustable and works wonderful. Happy customer"
Buy it,Great product. Buy it and save your money
Just the right size,Perfect size for my labels and sample size soaps.
Loved the colors!,They are ok for the price placed them  on my garage door! One of them was peeling off just wondering how long they will last.
Gives the Gucci Tote form!,"The insert fit perfectly in my medium size gucci tote. My bag looks better with structure/form. Also it has lots of pockets for sunnies, cards, cell phone, pens, small wallet etc."
Good,Good
Not a perfect fit but it works well and costs 1/3 of the OEM part,"I replaced the original light on our 2012 Armada with this assembly. No issues getting everything hooked up, it's just a pain to get to the light. I actually liked that it didn't come with any pigtails for anything, so I just disconnected everything from the old light after I removed it from the spoiler. I didn't have to run anything back through the liftgate. The fit is not 100% perfect, as the gap at the edge between the light and the cutout in the spoiler is slightly larger than it needs to be. It's not noticeably off, though. Hard to knock it for the price - $40 plus tax. Cheapest I could find from Nissan was about $123. Next cheapest is Dorman for $90."
It's Wonderful!,My dad with Alzheimer's had been struggling to remember what day of the week it was. As soon as I installed this clock for him I noticed a  HUGE difference in his attitude and memory. It almost feels like he's improved! He now knows what day it is and is now more confident in himself. This purchase was worth every penny!!! Thank you!!
Shed terrible,Received and washed shed terrible. Will need numerous washes before you can use. If you can use at all.
Damaged and in the wrong box,"It’s pretty. However, the kettle, which the seller claims is new, was inside a hastily taped together box from a different kettle (see picture) and the kettle lid was bent and didn’t close all the way. I returned it."
Expensive as hell but a must have,Expensive as hell but a must have
Great value and fit,"I was impressed.  Well packaged, easy to fit and meets its intended purpose.  Its moisture wicking is awesome.  They decently stand the test of the washing machine.  Great product for golf, mountain biking, hiking or jogging.  Recommend 100%"
Fun item,Really enjoying our Eufy  Need to pick up little rugs and get a couple of cords out of the way.
Keep it on,Awesome
"Mmmmmmm. Creamy, sweet, wonderful!","Rich, creamy & sweet. I got addicted to Carnation malted milk powder while I was on house arrest during Covid. My favourite way to eat it is sprinkled over vanilla ice cream with peanut butter, squished together with my spoon. Almost any milkshake is better with malt, especially carmel or butterscotch. Try it for yourself and you'll understand why everyone over a certain age used to talk about going to the drive in and  drinking malts. SMART GENERATION!!!"
It works!,"Love the method and ease of use. Plus, keeps the wine fresh for extended days on end. Works great!"
My Go To Holster,"Great holster for my glock 26 gen 4. The edges are super smooth and the gun clicks in tight. The carbon fiber texture slides nicely into your waistband, if I'm running out to the store or doing my everyday activities I always use this holster."
a bit snug,just a little snug on me DD breasts and a bit of a tummy but overall i like the shirt
ok,ok does the job
LO QUE BUSCABA,Wow buen producto
Not Very Strongly Scented.,I really wanted to like this but it was gone very quickly and didn’t have a very strong scent unfortunately. Sorry!
Thank you  to all fighters,My son-in-law is a volunteer fire fighter and my prayers always goes out him and the team when they go out on a call a small token of my thanks
timely,good
Smart easy and works great!,The ram traveled from Las Wegas to Norway in a weekend:-) As advertised they are splendid for my gaming and office use.
Works well definitely worth it,Very relaxing love it
Adjustable to Smaller but,There is only one size to buy here and then it adjusts down. I never considered having a large head but I guess I have a large head. I have to cram this on. Be aware that this is not a one size fits all hat.
Simplicity,My family used to purchase C batteries fkr our kids toys. The down side to that was that they were expensive. Ever since we found this brand we have not gone through as many. Having rechargeable batteries has simplified things and it has also saved us money.
I love this!!! So happy I bought it!!,Love it!!
Love This Nightlight,"I love this nightlight! It looks really nice (I got the nickel finish), it comes right on when you turn the lights out. Has many colors and is bright enough to light the bathroom at night."
Really love this brush!,I already knew this would be a good brush prior to buying but I am happy with the purchase.  I may go back and get a wider one though.  I have fine hair and it works grea0t but the wider paddle may have been more appropriate for my hair type. Other than that it's very sturdy and definitely built to last.
Love it,"Okayyy this is my holy grail. Clean, fresh and not leave dry skin. Will buy again"
Great stuff,This has helped with pain in my shoulder and back.
Worth spending money,Nice stuff.
Awesome,Great item looks great and it’s easy to install
A decent purchase in 2021,The phone itself is pretty fast still in 2021. Not much random weird apps included with the phone except for apps PC utility and Phone check. The phone itself has only glitch out on me once so far. The fingerprint reader works 4/5 times and the battery life is enough for one day.
Fit my son perfectly,Perfect fit. Hard to find size 31 so very happy with these.
Terribly unhappy,This is horrible to put together. I wish I had never bought it. The wooden dowels break and the surface breaks.  It’s horrible.  I need a replacement
Great,I put them on the side of my fridge and they have worked perfectly so far
Great machine,"This is my second Brothers nachine.Great machine. Dependable, smooth, easy to use."
If you live in city and keep grass done not high ok .,Not as good as should be and weed eater not as powerful as expected.
Much easier to use,"So lately gas cans have become so safe they are mostly unusable! We bought this one because reviews noted it was easier to use. We found the safety pushbutton much easier to use with our 70+ year old arthritic thumb. While still annoying,  at least it was functional.  We will buy another one to use with the gas/oil mix for our other lawn tools."
This product exceeded our expectations.,"This product came completely assembled, is well made, is sized to meet our needs and fits well in our kitchen."
It does what it needs to do,"I use this for my USB mic, and it works. It does what it needs to do. I highly recommend this."
Wet and Forget says it all,Spray it on and walk away. Rinse the next day. Works amazingly well.
Good for natural set but flimsy,The tips are nice if you want to do a natural looking mani without the need of making your own French tip. The downfall is the tips are flimsy and the case opens very easily as well. The rest of my sets were discarded due to the contents popping all over the floor.
Awesome well worth the price.,I love it.
Worst tasting protein I have ever tried.,This protein taste like pure plastic/chemicals. Probably the single worst tasting protein I've ever tried.
Fun,Liked as a present
Love this soil!!,Great soil!!
Bad part,Trim is out of allingment?
What can I really use safely to clean it,I really like it up to now it was worth it perfect size..
Value for the money!,"I think that this met my expectations, and is worth the money!!"
Love these,Love the way they absorb moisture from condensation from cold glasses
This is a very sturdy piece of furniture,"I am so happy I ordered this as I have been looking for almost 2 years for a farmhouse TV stand and this is just what I wanted. Its sturdy, it was easy to put together and it is a nice piece of furniture. Ty so much"
busted open!,I can honestly say that I used to love Hefty trash bags however after getting these bags lately I am extremely disappointed in their quality.  I have had quite a few these bags bust open at the bottom when taking to the trash can so much that I now have to double bag it until the box is done before I start using a different brand.
Grainy.,So grainy!! I cannot for the life of me get a glossy finish.
Perfect little outfit,"Loved this little outfit, it was perfect for our little one!"
Sturdy with a lot of space.,Very easy to assemble. Light but sturdy. Lots of room for mom and 5 pups.
Great for beginners,Great product good quality easy to lay a spread Well definitely recommend
Must Have,Absolutely love! Best maternity workout leggings yet!
Fits perfect and fingerprint tab was easy to remove,Fits perfect and fingerprint tab was easy to remove
Hasn't warped !,"Gave as a gift, and our daughter is thrilled."
A little disappointing,So I  though they were going to be thick and fluffy... A little disappointing
Really disappointed,I loved the softness of this top and it looked like it would be flattering with the model.  I wear it but only at home.  The sleeves are way too long (I got a medium) and the sides are so straight that it doesn't show any shape on me - so i wasn't willing to wear it in public.
Works great,Works great
Very cute,This bathing suit is so cute and patriotic .. love it and it fits great too
Much prefer the loose tea to the bags,I love the quality of Vahdam teas. I prefer the loose tea to the tea bags though. I have to use two tea bags to give me the flavor and strength I desire.  It looks like perhaps 1/2 teaspoon of tea in each bag.
Perfect,Was exactly what I wanted
Fat Cat is in Bed Nirvana!!!,"This is the Plushest, Prettiest, Softest, most Cozy pet Bed Ever!!!  Best price for such luxury and beauty!!!  The ivory color even looks good in my living room!!  My Fat Cat got in it before I even decided where I would put it, and before it was totally fluffed out!!!  He owns it, if he isn't eating or peeing!!  Lazy cat is just gonna get fatter, but he Loves Me SO much for getting him this bed!! My shy sweet cat hasn't had a chance to try it yet!!!  Beautiful bed!!  Thank you!!"
Pibble-approved and pibble-proof,"My pup loves this toy, super durable and suction power is enough for a 60lb pibble. I filled it up with treats and he can entertain himself for a while. I have to literally wrestle it away from him when play time is over."
Love it,Great product
Leak,I was soaked.  Worthless product.  Return.
Good sweat pants for the money.,This product is as expected.
Perfect,Perfect
Amazing humidifier!,I've been using it everyday since I bought it. Best humidifier I've ever owned!
Not good at all!!!!,The candy is old and is busted. No liquor inside at all. Not satisfied at all. Paid good money for nothing!!!
great,softness
waste of $$$,"I've probably used this vacuum around 10 times. the first few times it worked fine. then, after a few seconds of vacuuming (with a fully charged battery), it would simply power down.  It's now been nearly a year since my purchase, but these problems were happening shortly after purchase.  I completely cleaned the vacuum and cully charged the battery just to see if it was user error, but to no avail."
Cheaply made,I wanted to love this purse so bad ! I actually like the shape but the front detail came scratched up and cheaply made it looks like someone hurried and super glued before it was sent to me. Even parts of the rhinestone are missing on the top. I’m sad because I wanted this for vacation two days away I’m not even able to return it
Huge fans of these M&D puzzles,My almost 3 year old absolutely loves these puzzles!
So perfect,Great for small ears
Fun,It was fun to put together but Took a while to put together
Great product,I didn't use these as nursing pads. I used them on days I didn't feel like wearing a bra.
Good Quality,Excellent shirts for the price.
Great Product,I use this for squats and its been perfect for challenging me. Already seeing great results!
A Great Starter,"I'm new to the stationary hobby and hope to grow my collection, this has been a great purchase as it comes with just about everything you need with ample supplies to try things. Especially for being under $30, it's great."
It worked ok...,Touchscreen was difficult to use with case on.
Flexible soft shoe storage.,"These bags are good for packing shoes in luggage or in the car for road trips. The shoes are easily identifiable through the clear vinyl. I have one pair of hiking boots that don't fit together in one bag. But gym shoes, walking shoes, sandals etc, can be packed together. Also, I like them for  storing stuff. 24 is a lot. You probably will think of ways to use them."
Easy for on the go use,"So cute! Good color, fits perfectly."
Looks Great!,"I sealed my back patio (brick pavers) and the front entrance.  So far, everything looks just like I expected it to!"
Beautiful,I bought these for my sister who loved them! They actually water a little bigger then I expected. It was the perfect gift
Cute,This cute thing is easy to clean the stem makes it easy to hold too. Packaged nicely.
Blends well,Easy to apply
Tastes great every time,I like the dark chocolate flavor
What a deal!!!,"Noticed that they had a bundle deal through Amazon. I got both of these items for less than the cost of one at most retail stores. I’m excited to use these again. After having a baby via C-section, are used both of these products on my C-section scar. Using this duo for my scar from surgery not to mention the loose skin from pregnancy."
Very happy!,Exactly what we needed to fit it a small kitchen counter space for added storage. Seems durable and sturdy. Great buy for the price!
"Great product, highly recommended","This massage gun has very minimum noice, and the battery last very long."
�,Fast service. The product it is good
Best purchase ever!,Best purchase ever!
Great looking well made,"Love this vest, pretty and smart looking, well made for the price."
To tiny,It was to tiny to wrap candy in!
Great value,Great quality.
Extremely soft,Blanket and lovely are extremely soft and comfortable
Pkg was in crumbs.,It was as if pkg had been crushed.  Patties were all broken up and crumbles. My dog only eats in pieces so this pkg was no good for him. No way to contact seller.
Overall no major complaints,Instructions could be a bit better but overall I like this item. Perfect for what I needed in my bathroom. Very sturdy and compact.
Sturdy case,"This case is sturdy and protects the phone well. The reason I gave it a 4 instead of 5 was because the cover for the charging port is on so well, it takes effort to open and use it, but overall that's not a big deal. I'd recommend it."
Pet hair helper,"I wasn't sure that I would love it as much as I do. But with having pets and being tired of pet hair, this thing is great. I run it every day, and it helps keep the level of pet hair next to nothing."
Great lights!,The 65ft was long enough to go all around the room and had a few ft left over.
do not trust!,outer cap was on but inner seal was broken
Hummers love it,Brightly colored and very well made.
Perfect,Works as ordered! ���
Beautiful swimsuit!,Perfect fit! I love this swimsuit!
Super light and comfortable!,I love this fan! It’s super light and you can bend it to fit your neck comfortably. I can’t wait to use it at Disneyland!
Great lightbulbs!,"Installation wasn't the most straightforward process. It took a few attempts to get all the lightbulbs to connect, and registering my profile with Google didn't save my password so I had to reset it. Once I got everything hooked up and my Google account linked well, it was smooth sailing from there. I love being able to control the lights with either my voice or the Google Home app. Makes everything so convenient."
Love it!!,I love it!!!  Beautiful for my sun room..
Perfect,Absolutely beautiful!
Beautiful!,"Loved it so much I bought two just in case something happens to the first one! The cloth feels great, color is perfect, I love the look."
Style,Nice product
Would get it again,They even have a soft place to put the rings.  It’s so cute and I love it.
Puppy fun!,"My puppy definitely loves splashing around in this! Haven't really tried to properly fold it back up, but it does seem pretty simple."
exactly as shown,i got this for myself and my best friend . seeing as i like silver and she likes gold ; the black option was so perfect . it looks exactly as pictured and the chain length is perfect length . solid clasp also . she absolutely loved it !
nice mini computer,"very nice mini computer. fast, quiet and price is right."
Ehhhh,It easily disconnects...
Runs small!,Not true to size :(
Easy to load,"Pull the plunger all the way back, unscrew pump end from gun tube, remove plastic cap from grease cartridge and insert new grease cartridge into gun tube. Pop aluminum cap from grease cartridge and reinstall pump side to gun tube. Release spring and pusk plunger up inside tube. Burp gun using pressure release and you are ready to go."
Can't wait to use it,"Haven't had a chance to use it yet, but looks great and good price"
Instructions,Talking to family & friends
Not made well,"I love this concept. I like to take baths and watch my netflix shows. Mine came and it wouldn't close all the way. I did not try it out since i was worried it wouldn't hold my phone in and would fall in the water. I forgot to return it on time, so its just sitting in my closet."
Not happy AT ALL,"If my daughter hadnt given her old tv stand away already, I would have returned this piece of junk, cant believe I spent 200.00 on it."
Is sturdy but canopy is not strong,Canopy isn't strong enough
To work,"Is working as is supposed to, thank you"
Can't Give a Good Rating if It Doesn't Work,"I bought this thing with high hopes but was very disappointed in the end.  I followed all the instructions to install it and got to the point where you turn the power on and connect it to your network.  When I did that, I didn't get the expected white LED lights on the doorbell. I got some other version that indicated a problem.  When I went to find out what the lights meant, the first time I read that I had an inadequate transformer.  Great! So my first issue with this system is that it can't work with transformers that are already in your house. You have to have a special transformer on your doorbell. If you have anything other than a modern home, you might want to check your transformer before getting this doorbell.  Apparently there is not enough power in the standard transformer for this item."
Doesn’t work,This product doesn’t work at all. I’m not sure if it’s fake but I don’t recommend.
Nice shoe,Nice shoe just cut small
It fit my printer,Nothing yet
Fantastic quality,"True to size, these are an easy buy, affordable, and great quality overall!"
works good,just as ordered
Exceptional customer service,Upgraded my review based a exceptional customer service. My first item failed after a couple weeks and this company went out of their way to address the problem. They contacted me directly and have Tupac the fault device. New device is great so far.
"So cute, very sturdy, kids loved them!!","These are so cute, kids loved them and they were not cheaply made!"
Plenty to go around.,I love the colors & the quality of the gloves. Highly recommend.
Value and quality,Great set of lights and the price is even better
A very good no-frills electric brush,"The small rotating brush head works well and reaches all parts of the mouth easily. That's the single most important reason to buy this device. The 30 second stutter reminder is a useful feature to time the brushing of each quadrant. There is no auto shutoff after 2 mins, but I don't find this to be consequential. The entire device is washable under running water, which is necessary each time.  I leave the brush in the charger all the time. The absence of more fancy features is really not a big deal. Basic brushing works very well with the design of the brush head and the reasonably quiet motor. I have to see how long this lasts, but I'd recommend this brush highly. Only reservation is that the price seems a little high for this setup."
It’s all cotton and comfy.,I have bought these for several years and they are comfortable and breathable.
????????,Will buy again
Adorable,So cute! Good quality. A little big on my two month old but that was expected. Everyone thought she looked adorable
Beautiful product.,Love Maybelline.
Not fancy,"These are mid-weight red plastic. Sturdy enough for top shelf of the dishwasher. Not at all fancy, but hold three tacos upright for easy filling and serving.  Flip over for a stand for two tacos.  Perfect for our weekly taco night."
Too big,"I did buy size 0-3 but its too big. However i like it, soft material and warm"
Multipurpose Griddle!,"The best part is the non stick part. Its very easy to use and clean after. I have used griddles before but not this big one. I was a little skeptic to get this one as it was big, but it fits fine and being large I can make multiple Dosa's or Roti's at a time. It saves lot of time and effort when we have guests over. It's a very handy device worth the buy. Was packed good and delivered on time."
"Warm, confortable.","Caps fit well, is very comfortable, warm and easy to put the helmet over. The eyeglass slots are very easy to insert frames."
Disingenuous description and pictures,After ordering the product we realized that the picture on the box is not what is in the box. The picture on the box displays a feature called segments which this model does not have. It is the entire reason we ordered this model. Very disappointed.
Works,Perfect
All 3,All 3 reasons. For drawing an writing
$150 down the drain.,It works well for what it is however I got one and a half uses over fall and spring out of it before the axel failed. All of the torsional strength come down to the threads on either end of this adjuster rod. If that nut loosens at all the the threads cannot support the stress. It’s a custom part and not replaceable from what I can find. Poor design relying on a $.03 part. $150 down the drain.
You want to know if it really works or not.  And it does.,"For my Diabetic , it helps me.  Don"
Beautiful!!!!,"Okay, so I bought 2 of these. The black and the deep blue.  I am 5'6"" and all legs with a short torso. My 6' hubby and I have the same length legs. My waist is about a 40"". I usually wear XL or an XXL if I want it a lil roomier. So, I bought the PLUS on both of them. The dark blue was perfect, but the black was tighter in the waist. Its fine if you dont have tummy issues. But if you do, it will be too tight on your tummy. You must be very careful washing these because they both bleed..even in cold water. And you DO NOT want to dry. These will shrink...a lot!  So all in all, they are spectacular looking...with lots of detail. The black have small beeds on it...making it VERY eye catching. Both have lace on the bottom. Very swishy and feminine. The blue kinda looks like jean material, but isnt. Deninitely worth the buy!!"
Great gaming chair!,Feels like a throne
Soonsun gopro 8 Battery Door Fits perfect,"This 3rd party replacement door fits better than the original Gopro door. Plus it has a slot for the USB-C cable. I never use mine around water, so I don't need it waterproof and if I did, just pop the original door back on. Fits nice and even and level to the gopro case body."
Good Value,I was looking for an air cooler for my office and this one was perfect. I actually kept it for my bed stand and exchange the old one for my office due that this one is better. It keeps me cooler than the old one and let me sleep all night because it doesn't make noise. It is worth the money.
Un-lasting Beauty,"Beautiful at first, faded very fast (within a month) and looks very worn. Not worth the money spent on it????"
Disappointed,"These are not flat on the bottom, and they are only 6mm in the center. Not what i was expecting. Im thinking these are going to be too thin. You can see on the ruler that they are 3.74 long and the caliper shows the 6mm thickness. Will look for a better product"
Nice and colorful,These look amazing over my windows and the colors are perfect... the only thing I would like more is for the fabric to be thicker.
good solid workmanship,"LOOKS GOOD ON MY WALL, EASY TO READ"
Handsomely attractive bracelets for men,"Great bracelet! Very well built, has very nice fit and finish. These make great gifts, I treated myself to two different variations."
Good for Walking,"I wear orthotics and got a size larger and wider. I’m glad for that. The shoes are a bit stiff and not for running. I’m an avid walker and do 5 miles per day , rain, shine, snow or heat. These fit well and comfortably right out of the box.  In snow they had a fairly good grip. Nothing works on ice. They’re probably not waterproof but my toes don’t get wet in an inch or 2 of snow like in my old shoes. Support is excellent, probably why they feel stiff. But will probably loosen up over time.  My othodics provide arch support so I can’t rate these on that issue. These are trail shoes as they claim and not running shoes. Good enough."
the 1 star is only to be able to post a warning,"For beginners, the box was torn completely apart. I immediately tossed the ""cheese"" in the garbage. I managed to gnaw my way through 2 sticks of stale pepperoni."
Great ear buds!,"They are very easy to use once you get the hang of it. It took me a while to adjust them in my ears, but other than that, no problems and I like them!"
excellent for oil painting,"This is an excellent brush for oil painting, easy to make different brush strokes, easy to clean and it is very durable. I wll buy again in different size."
Sexy,I bought this for my night birthday outfit and I’m glad I read all the reviews I’m slim thick I was so scared but I purchased a xl I have wide hips big thighs and it fits perfectly fine !!!! I love the color
This is best brand,Works great!
High recommended!,Love love the product and it works like magic! Highly recommended for those who has deep skin scars on your face this product is very good ! Thank you seller fast and good packaging!
Good cover,I watched the video on how to attach the screen protector. It helped make it easier. I liked how the cover had a design on it that showed how to line up the phone before you took it off.
So beautiful and soft,Both my girls loved this rug as soon as they saw it! One of them will hardly keep it on the floor because she’d rather wrap up in it. Colors are great and it’s super soft.
Good Product Good Value,I bought to scan my '17 Chevrolet Cruise it does what is says
Exceeded Expectations,We are very happy with how this turned out. We gave formatting liberty to the seller and they did a great job. Would definitely recommend.
Food tongs,Excellent product and service
Good quality but too thick.,Too thick.
Works great,Great light!
Cat likes it,My cat is a finicky water drinker which led to a lot of dehydration problems. He seems to have taken to this water fountain tho!
Too small,They were way too small for a medium
Love!!,Soft and cuddly. Its my son's new favorite blanket!
Parts Missing/Broken,The charger was missing and some wires were broken.  I emailed the company with no answer so far (less than 24 hours).
Quality of product!!,Met all my expectations. Would buy again from this seller!!
Cute and comfortable,"Love the variety in the package. Packaging is first-class, too."
"Good product, saves you money on chip clips!","I really like this product and it will save me money since I don’t need chip clips anymore. It may take a few tries to get it right, but it’s very useful!"
Stop charging after 3 uses.,I only used it a couple of times and it stop charging
Nice skirt,Fits great and is very cute and flattering
A very good product!,It worked as advertised. Maca by Naturalize Labs increase my stamina and my libido. My wife loves it also.
Read all instructions in the booklet!,What a great system! So easy and the instructions are very helpful for first timers!!
I recommend,"I’m in love with this product, I loved the color it work really well. Im very recommend this product"
Just the right ones for my battery,The cables fit perfect
Great product,"It actually looks better than the picture shows, quality is great, light weights and easy to use. Maybe try to make it in different colors?"
I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.. very cheaply made,Wasn't a good product at all. It kept tearing apart
Daughter is loving her Green Screen,We used it to hang up the green screen and now my daughter is taking photos for my company and doing a great job for a 8 y/o
Enclosed dust cap,They look good on my vehicles
Best product out there!,I got this for my wife and she couldn’t be happier!
Runs very wide.,The shoe is well made but heavy.  I could not adjust Velcro straps tight enough to prevent my foot from slipping around and therefore I could not clip or unclip easily when mountain biking.
Easy and quick,I wanted a more sanitary way to check my temperature rather then the old fashioned thermometer. And i love it. Its easy to use and quick.
Appearance,"I was not disappointed with the wreaths.  I did not need a very colorful addition to my house, that will come in the spring. It was the appearance of springtime breaking through that attracted me to the wreaths."
Love these!!,"I never leave review but knew I had to for these. If you are up in the air, don’t hesitate and get these!! I have had them up for a few weeks now and have not had any peeling. I was able to do this all by myself. What I found worked was to cut them out and tape on the wall where I wanted them. That way I didn’t have to take them off after I got them on. I used a credit card to get out any bubbles and smooth them out. I wanted it to look more like wallpaper on the one wall. Love how they turned out and have gotten a ton of compliments on them."
Wrong size,This item supposed to be a 5qt
What it said it was,Great product!
Smaller than I thought they would be,My girls are always shaking off the old style tags so I thought this a better style.  Not difficult to get on
Nice cinnamon,Not as good as the Vietnamese one I got from same place
Beautiful,Beautiful color great material.
"Some reviewers were missing bags... well, I got an extra!","Which really I'm not rating that as a positive thing, since... that's just... well, poor quality control. If some people are getting shorted and some people are getting extra there's definitely something wrong with the system in place for sorting these things. Otherwise though I've opened and tried four of my five bags and they were all good except for one which was borderline hard and chewy rather than the soft gummy texture the rest had. I can't REALLY fault that, since... I mean, I've gotten bad bags from the grocery store too, but... still, kind of a points deduction there, plus the lack of care in packaging. Otherwise good."
Teal Marble,It is absolutely beautiful ???? the colors are vibrant and print isn’t blurry. Easy to put on and fits perfectly. Great product for the price.
Very flimsy and wouldn't stay up to the front  window.,Automobile
Cool to have,Nasty taste
Love it,Great to keep butter
What is pictured in the product page is FRAUD,"Funny thing, I ordered this before due to the pandemic and used it and was happy with the product. I made a second order, and they only shipped 3 items instead of 4. I started looking into it, and realized that they are shipping something other than what they are advertising."
I think it works it’s just difficult with a marker,I have a male cat that just insists upon marking I’ve tried this and the remover I think it probably does it’s job but he is doing his job stronger LOL
Buy it!,This stuff is amazing! Held decorations to the wall for 4 days and easy to take down without wall damage.
I would like my refund it is dented,I need to send it back it was a used one the microphone speaker is dented
2 sizes too small,2 sizes too small. Very thin
"Didn't last long, snapped about a week later, no good reason...",Cheaply made
Best Invisible bras ever!!!,"Real product and display picture is consistent, without any color different, material quality is very good! Also, the price is very inexpensive, chest stick very nicely chest, very sticky, together and has good effect, use up very comfortable, without any allergic reactions. It can also use water to clean after use, immediately back to the appearance of new, It's amazing!"
Adorable!,Love this accent lamp! Added such character to my kitchen desk! Very well crafted!
Disappointed,Couplings leak intermittently. Especially when there is movement in the hose.  I have a Bostitch pancake compressor and after reading mostly positive reviews I was expecting a solid product. Unfortunately this hose does not meet my expectations and the leaky couplings forces my compressor to run more frequently.
Great,My students absolutely loved these!
Quality great for price,The quality is great for the price! Sticky enough to stay on for long periods of time but don’t hurt when you take them off!
mine doesn't work,it doesn't work - I cannot talk through wired headphones and charge the phone at the same time
Easy to use and no mess,"Instead of trying to make a sugar solution, this liquid nectar is so much better and it does not contain red dye. Another plus compared to other products"
Love!!,"I just repurchased this. The first one lasted me about 2 years with daily use. The alarm stopped working one day, but in all fairness, I did drop it a bunch of times :/ I love waking up to the light and the alarm music is not insanely annoying, but peaceful. I put it across the room so I'm facing the ""sunrise."" I'll probably always have one of these, and will more than likely stick with this brand."
Great,Loved them.
Very well,Very good
It really fits to your size.,"Excellent for meeting, going to work, going to a friendly gathering, going to a restaurant extra...."
h,I love the lashes ????
Sizing is strange,"I purchased a 2x, which is what I normally wear. The bottom part fit perfectly, the top however, is a mess. I'm pretty busty (40DD), and I don't fill it out. It also shifts to the side so much I think its sewn incorrectly! The dress is quite beautiful, but I don't know how I'm going to fix the issue with the top."
Easy to Use,"Super easy to use!  Small, portable!"
Adequate when assembled.,"Product did not come with all parts, had to wait a week to get other parts. Also instructions for assembly were not good."
Comfortable and stays in place.,I have medium length thin hair that I like to twist up on the back of my head. This holds it nicely and comfortably and actually closes all the way over the twist so it doesn't fall down. It is also more comfortable if I have to lean my head back than some of the other clips.
Nice,Great product. Fast delivery. Will buy again
"Easy to install, fast shipping",We love ordering from Waterdrop. It’s so easy to find the filter that fits our fridge and the quick shipping is incredible. I cannot believe how much Samsung charges for filters so being able to buy two at half the price of one is AMAZING. We will absolutely keep ordering from waterdrop!
Love ❤️ these rings,"I love these rings, great quality and beautifully crafted"
Dissatisfied,I really don’t like anything about it. Slow to make coffee. Very very noisy while perking. Hard to clean and pour water in tank. Wish I dad sent it back.
So far so good,"Finally pull the trigger to buy a masticating juicer to complement the Vitamix blender. There is definitely a learning curve and the poorly written instruction of the juicer cause quite some confusion in assembly and cleaning. Ignoring the instruction, the juicer is actually easy to put together and very easy to clean with the included brushes. It is sturdy and the noise level is fine for what it does. The juice tastes great and, judged by the dryness of the pulp, this juicer offers maximum amount of juice. I already figure out a favorite receipt for the hot days. Two medium size carrots, one apple, two handful kale, one small piece of ginger and a slice of lemon. Absolutely loves it."
Doesn’t do anything,Took ages to widen an existing hole in an aluminum frame in my car. Probably spent about 5 minutes to widen the hole by 1-2mm.
This beautiful harness has a reflective strip which is nice for our evening walks.,"She grew out of her medium one and this one  fits perfectly.  Also, she is much more obedient with her service dog harness on!"
Xoxo! Meowwww ^.^,"This is kitten's most favorite toy of all timeeeee! Super sturdy and durable, hell, even I enjoy it when we play together. Pretty rainbow twirling ribbon. Really good toy for bonding."
Go ahead n buy!!,Product as described thanks will be ordering again in another color
Would  get them again,They where what I  expected
Bonito pero con detalles,"El Kong nos gustó mucho pero desafortunadamente traía dos defectos: una pierna floja que se le cae fácilmente y la segunda cabeza no embona. El vendedor fué muy profesional, me respondió rápido y me hizo un reembolso."
Good for fragrance oils,"Perfect for my fragrance oils! They are very convenient and all of the droppers work well, I ordered another set of 24 since I am expanding my soap/perfume business."
Great smell - left a residue.,"Like the smell - long lasting. It is more of an oil base so when it’s sprayed in the air, it left a residue."
Nice for filling in the lows,"Like others have said, not going to thump. More like a home theater sub. Fills in all of the lows that 5 1/4 or 6 1/2 speakers can't."
"After 9 months of daily use, this woman isn't impressed with claims",The Seller has repeatedly answered negative Amazon reviews by writing "use for 8 months minimum" and so I'm going into my 9th month (which will be my last purchase). I seriously doubt I will suddenly see changes in the 9th and last month of usage. Can we all agree that thinning hair or hair loss occurs due to many factors and what works for some here doesn't work for others? The price has fluctuated over the last 9 months but I'm out of pocket over $200 for a wild experiment I was desperate to try. Lesson learned.
Don’t cutting the packing because you might end up cutting the wipe.,It was easy to put on the phone. I didn’t need instructions on how to do it. I enjoyed the tempered glass that came for the phone.
Good Filters,Needed a new swimming pool filter. Filters are always perfect and very good seller. Filter arrived early.
Appears to work very well,"I purchased this in January 2021.  Initial tests throughout the house were in the 6.5 range even though I have been running a radon exhauster for several years on a 6 hour per day schedule.  I upped this to 8 hours which lowered the reading a little. Tested the unit outside which showed a .62 reading. Getting concerned, I purchased and installed a Honeywell ERV.  After some experimental checking, I have the ERV on low continuous, furnace fans on circulate and the radon exhauster on 2 hrs morning and 2 hours evening.  Radon now at about 2.0.  3,000 SF house air is much fresher and radon level is good - basement,  main level and upper master bedroom, all uniform at about 2.0.  I now have at our lake house.  Outside reading = .2.  Need to see what inside reading looks like this summer when closed up with a/c on."
"Superior product, durable and reliable",I love this product. I use it ten times a day at least.
Love this thread,"Great thead, nice color selection."
Great and worth it!,"Well worth money. Must use UV lamp, but after that you can go on with your day."
Even the elderly can use the echo,Echo is great. Turns on lights before I enter rooms and plays music I like.
Decent shorts,These are pretty good shorts. Nice for lounging around or doing workouts. Not something I'd probably wear too often or wear out as they aren't really my style and kind of made of material similar to some wind pants I used to have and I just don't particularly care for that look or feel. Otherwise they're good. I can stretch and move easily in the them. Nothing major to complain about more of just a personal taste and preference. Overall I like and would recommend for someone looking for something like these.
Perfect!,"Just what I needed. They fit, I can see!"
Great distractor,I have two small dogs that get into barking matches. This item will magically make them stop long enough to forget what they were barking about. It's been a real "ear" saver!!
"Comfort, shade and worth the coatt",Works great for holding baby up out of the water and doesn't flip
Not pleased.,The only thing I can say about this is that it’s warm. It’s no where near as fluffy as they claim it to be.
Not worth it,"Was excited for the desk but was a little hesitant because the reviews seemed 50/50 but thought how bad could it be? Well, it was horrible. The instructions given are not helpful at all, the measurements on the wood were incorrect, and worst of all the wood cracked. A total waste of money and who was the time or energy to return this huge thing? Not worth it."
Easy to use,So easy to use. No messy trays. Low price.
My favorite skirt!  I got it in 2 more colors!,"It's cute, sturdy, swishy, goes great with my crop tops, and sits comfortably at my waist!  After a while, I also got it in blue and pink!"
Support not strangling!,"Finally found a bra that fits big boobs, supports without wire and is actually comfortable and not strangling. Bought a second one!!"
Buen material.,Es muy buen material y bien grande. Me encanta
Failed after normal use,"After 8 months the upper swivel pulled out of the 2 or 3 threads that were there. Up until this point, we loved it."
Garbage,"Two shots from a 30-30, and the lens fell out."
Quilty,Easy to use
My niece loved it:),Very cute
Trying to wipe it off it water got inside my package,"I open the package reached my hand in to pull out the product, my hand was filled with a substance..My product came with a Vaseline like substance in the package."
Not Nearly Responsive Enough,I am waiting for a Kawai keyboard to be in stock so I picked up this item just so I could get a jump learning to sight read... and so I could test drive couple of instructional apps. Unfortunately the responsiveness on this product is just terrible. I recognize how inexpensive it is... so I was not expecting much... but it is unusable for any educational purposes. Some notes randomly wont play no matter how hard you press the "key"... other times notes will play twice when the key is struck once. Makes it impossible to complete  virtually any exercise in any app.
Excelente para viajes de playa,Me encanto. La talla es acorde a lo descrito. Peso ligero e ideal para dias soleados
Right size,Tasty.
Love the design,I bought this for my bathroom and now want to buy another set for my kitchen. I love that the bottle quality and the stickers add such a nice touch. I highly recommend the amber color! Looks very chic
Don't buy used!,"I can deal with a little cosmetic blemishes, but this was really bad. Can't believe Amazon even considered reselling this item. RETURNED!"
Super modern,I used different one long time. But i liked this one more. More modern more clean looking. I have been some troubles cleaning the old one so after i used first time and tried to cleaning on this one woow super easy. This should be the top priority if i buy more diffuser.
Fun and Functional Pill Organizer,Absolutely love this pill organizer! It has a crack in the plastic but that doesn’t bother me since it doesn’t take away from the product’s functioning. It’s so easy to use and easy to grab in the morning! This has made taking my medicine consistently easier! Plus the design is so fun! I love the color and the push button!
Very thin and flimsy,"They work, but had I known they were so thin I would not have paid so much. Super thin, super flimsy for the money lol elsewhere."
Exactly what its supposed to be a hand ratchet,"It works as it should but it's not entirely what I was looking for. It would be nice if it could work with a ratchet,  rather than be the ratchet. Either way I did find something else that works better for my needs. However ill still be keeping this to see if it comes in hand, no pun intended."
Convenient. Awesome hair collection! Sharp?,"Was really convenient removing the hair, the cats seem to sort of like it. My medium hair kitty acts a little sensitive to it, but when I am gentle she is tolerant. The metal bristles are a tad sharp feeling to me, but my long hair loves it!"
Best decision I ever made for my pup! Amazing!,My dog has dermatitis due to food allergies. Her ears were so bad and scaled losing all her fur and getting repeat ear infections. They were so painful for her. I started giving her these as a last resort. She has now been taking 1 a day for almost two months now and her ears have completely healed! All the fur has grown back also! And her skin no longer itches. I can not express how pleased I am with these. Definitely ordering again!
Does not fit,This does not fit the S10 plus
Space saver,I don't have a gym membership so I wanted something that would fit my needs. These fitness bands fit the need. They are easy to set up and use. I have them in my home office  and can take a break anytime to relieve neck and back strain.. Love the resistance levels also. I can't think of any cons for this product. So glad I found these
Nice,Nice
A great investment for happy kitties!,This is one of the best grooming tools I’ve found yet. I have three cats with varying hair lengths/coat thicknesses and this works on all of them. The curved side gets deep into the undercoat of my domestic longhair and Lynx point Siamese (very thick but short hair) whereas the straight side is really good for my domestic shorthair since he doesn’t have as thick an undercoat. I’d definitely recommend this for any cat owner.
Not pleased,"The seller needs to mention, this is only the overlaying for a comforter"
So many uses!,"I’m going to buy another pack. We have these everywhere for convenience. Bike trailer, car seat, wheelchair. Depending on where you put them they can be a tad short so I connected 2 to make it longer."
Great price and charges fast,"I have an iPhone SE Gen 2, an iPhone 11, and AirPods Pro. The charger works great with all my devices and the charging is very fast. Note that the price on this one is lower than the other brands, but does not come with the charger brick for the wall, which is fine with me since I have a stack of them."
Crazy Cart,A++++
Pet Safe Dancing Dot,"My cat goes after reflected light and absolutely loves chasing the red beam around!  As soon as he hears the beep when I turn it on, he comes running!"
America the Pillow,"This pillow cover just screams America. I think if I was to cut into it now, it would bleed red white and blue. Performs perfectly with it’s main function of cushioning my back. Nice thick material and good quality, just like the country I love so much!"
It is good they did not cut it,Can't say anything about the product as they put it folded in the small envelope. Anyway it is good they did not cut it in 2-3 pieces.
Best vitamins,These are so good. I was looking for something easy to chew and these are definitely it.
Bueno,Bueno para trabajar
Excellent Product for the Beginner,I purchased this for our friends 7 year old son for Christmas and he absolutely loves it.  He was able to learn everything quickly and thoroughly enjoys flying it!  Would purchase another as a gift if the occasion arises.
"I'm Not Blue, Happy","This item was nothing short of wonderful!  I'm an early packer whenever I'm traveling.  It's rare last minute plans come up.  Blue is my signature color and now my blue cubes are my best friend.  I packed for a 12 day stay, and was able to compress everything I was wearing and include all my toiletries and daily health products without my suit case screaming for mercy.  I loved it so much, I bought one as a gift for my daughter.  And hers is blue also."
Have a soft towel handy if you purchase this,"The screen protector, protects the screen, but you have to clean it hourly because it picks up the slightest bit of oil.  Due to the fingerprint scanner, ZAGG couldn't used Tempered Glass, so we are stuck with using this one.  Just have a glass cleaner handy if you use this so that you can keep it clean."
????????,????????
Bezel Installment,"Instructions were easy to follow, and installation of the bezel went without any difficulties!"
SHOULD HAVE sent it back !!!!!!!!,"NOT HAPPY with the  Owl ,it claims that the sensor is good for up to 10ft certainly NOT TRUE,you have to put your hand within a foot of it before it goes off and the sound is so weak you can hardly hear it ,not to mention the eye’s there certainly aren’t VERY BRIGHT !!!!!!!!!!"
Color of product not as described.,The size was too small and the color was blue instead of grey that I wanted.  It was listed as dark grey but was actually blue.  I returned it.
Hive heaters,They work great for keeping my bee hives warm when it was below freezing. Put them in a top box with a 3/4 in osb with 2 vent holes in it for the heat to get in the hives. 3 in vents with mesh screen over the holes. They were very happy bee's. They do get very warm but with the separation to the hives made it perfect for them. So I got more and ceramic light fixtures for them so I can get them in the rest of my hives before winter comes again with the sub zero Temps. Now I can keep bee's through the winters now.
Broke fast,"This product was very inexpensive but it broke fairly easily. Like within 2 days. I’d spend more money on something sturdier, so I know it’ll last."
Nice backup battery for work,Real convenient at work or in the car.
Defective unit,"The unit I received appears to be defective. When installed, the fixture only produced a dull flickering light. Replaced with a Robertson unit which works as expected."
Fit,"very comfortable, fits well"
Perfect Fit,"A bit pricey but worth it, perfect fit"
"looks beautiful, but the scale is at the back, so the design should be improved.","It looks beautiful, but the scale is at the back, so the design should be improved."
Great Blender!,This hand blender does a great job blending hot soup. So much easier than pouring into a traditional blender and much easier to clean. It's also great for smoothies. Looking forward to trying the other attachments. Holds up to more expensive brands. I recommend!
Fits well,Perfect for our car Honda Civic. Would recommend
Aziz set up,Quality
So cute!,It’s the cutest! I bought this for my daughter for Easter and I think she’s gona love it. The colors are just so cute. I can’t get enough of it.
Way too lawngggg!,"Not truly universal.  Too long for my mower, so I have to fold or tie under front.  Way too long."
Good with reservations,The mitts and the trivets are good.  The little lobster grippers? Or whatever they're called aren't thick enough.  They get extremely hot when you pick something up.  Other than that they're nice for the price.
works to get smoke and nicotine off walls,"I love this product! I would definitely buy them again. I was looking for a way to clean 20 yrs of smoke and nicotine off my walls. Anyone who has ever done this knows just how difficult of a task it is. None of the various spray cleaning products I tried would work. I even tried using a vinegar solution without success. Out of desperation I tried a regular magic eraser on a test spot as a last resort before giving up and it came right off with little to no scrubbing! So when I saw they made a mop I just had to order a box. It absolutely worked wonders.  I did not use them on a mop handle though. I was working on the walls in my hallway and since its close quarters I found I had more control without one. I didn't even need to use any kind of soap with them, just a little water. The only improvement I feel would be necessary would be to make the magic eraser part of the sponge mop head a little thicker. I was afraid it wasn't going to be thick enough but it still got the job done."
Beautiful,"I have not done them yet, but everything arrived as described and the look beautiful.  Can't wait to do them."
Nice but no bluetooth,No bluetooth
Effective and easy to use,Easy to use and great for at-home or on the go use. Very helpful for my shoulder pain and any other soreness.
Beautiful lashes,Beautiful lashes
A must get item!,I like the feel and the fit. So light and comfortable.
Solar Charger/Power Bank,"As far as I can tell, the solar power bank not only is very durable, but it holds a lasting charge.  You don’t have to charge it quite as often because it holds enough charge.  The solar panel works wonders especially when you do not have an outlet nearby. It’s a tab but heavy but the most important thing is that it’s reliable to power up your devices anywhere you go."
Good quality,Good quality. The red card inside is attached to the wood.
Coolest lighter ever!,So cool!  Doesn't look cheap at all.  Can't wait to use it.
Tiene buena calidad,Me agrado mucho y lo utilizo en mi auto
Nail drill,Very small but easy to use and convenient
Not the most sturdy.,Not very sturdy but not a lot of money either.  Should have bought a better one.  Basically used for making smoothies.
This is so easy and safe to use.,"I had to use this to jump start a dead car battery as my car  RX350 was idled for a while.  The battery was so dead that I could not even open the car door with the remote and had  to use a key.  Although it took 3 tries, I was finally able to jump start my car."
Love it,"Perfect for what i needed it for. Using for church bag to carry my notebooks, Bible and pens. Durable and great value for the price."
Love these sandals,Perfect fit. Very comfortable
Good affordable 1/2" CNC cutting Bit,"Comes in plain envelope, and is stored in a sturdy plastic case.  No label on case so be sure to label the storage case so you know which bit is in it.  Used it to cut some 3/4"" Oak Plywood, and it did a great job with clean cuts and minimal splinters."
Cheap,"Piece of junk, sorry!! If you cycle at a gym this bike is like driving a a smart car vs a Cadillac. Feels very cheap, can't stand up on it,even with the tension very high. You drop down."
UV paint!,I'm a professional Face Painter and I'm using this for glow in the dark parties where we use UV light in face painting. It's perfect and I appreciate the speediness of your product arriving. Thank you so much
Don’t buy!!!,"Constantly falls off of my vents, my phone constantly falls out. It’s cause me to almost get into a accident. Don’t buy!!!! Not safe!!!"
$$ and shipping cost.,Shipping $$ is too high for 2oz wire.
Happy mother in-law ????????,"Bought this for my 84 yrs young mother in-law to replace another, that isn't available anymore. She loves it ???? she gardens everyday."
Quality,Nice quality
Excelente,Excelente
"Comfortable, slip resistant",Work great. I normally wear low cut boots that costs 4 x this and have to buy special insoles. These work just as good and look better. Slip resistant in oily conditions. They do squeak a little when on vct tile so no sneaking up on anyone.
Nice,The way its setup I can plug more large plugs in.
"This is a very bad cooker , do not buy this item","THIS is a very bad cooker, it will burn your finger tips if you touch the outside of the pot, even on low setting. Warranty is only good  if YOU pay for return  shipping costs."
Not happy with these,I usually like this brand but these ones seemed different in texture and make your face look white the original ones never did this and were thicker in texture.
A classic favorite,"Classic, sexy scent. Great casually & date nights"
Easy and fun,What I love about the slime kit is that they don’t have to actually make the slime but rather mix in fun little things to make the slime more fun. My daughter loves the kit.
Love it,Really good
Arrived completely smashed,Came in completely smashed! Teeny Tiny shards of glass are everywhere!
DAMN!!!,....just trust me
Pump doesn't work!!,I love the smell of this but the pump doesn't work and this is the second one from Hemps Lotion that is defective! Go back to your original pump that didn't have this issue! It's too much of a hassle to return it and hope to get one that works!
Stops working very quickly,"One thing I will say, it’s easy to install. However, I literally just got my lights and it has been no more than two months and they are broken already. They stopped working. The lights are a nice touch in your car but do not plan to have this long term."
Nice but super deep,"I must not have noticed that this is a DEEP pan meaning the pan portion is more like a bowl. There are good an bad points to that....for one, you can fit way more stuff in here to sautee without flipping stuff out of the pan. However, it also makes it harder to flip things like eggs or pancakes."
Awesome,These things are well worth the money. Got them for my teenage daughters room and they exceeded my expectations. Will definitely order again if needed.
works as advertised,"heat shield attached, rated for 100a"
Great holster!,"I like the extra protection a holster provides when I'm out and about, but I also really like my silicon magsafe case. This holster gives me both. It looks nice and appears to be well made and sturdy."
Buy them. Stop thinking about it and buy them.,"I have never recommended a product more than this loofa, I’ve sent the product link to at least a dozen people. I bought them mid-January and my love for it has only grown. I feel like a freaking dolphin. My skin is amazing, I didn’t even know it could be this soft. It’s like I did a full body sugar scrub but without the effort or cost. Buy them. Buy them now."
amazing product,amazing product that i ordered more lights to do my bedroom
Cereal wasn't put in a box,"My package was not a box....took forever to get here and when it did oh my goodness so messed up...was in a yellow millia folder ,torn , cereal box torn and mashed.....cereal bag got a hole somewhere, somehow, ..it was a mess"
Great watch,"Keeps really good time (It's a Casio).  Looks beautiful. Perfect size.  It is easy to read in daylight.  At night it is tougher for me to read, as my eyes are old. But it is now the watch I wear the most and it was a great bargain."
This is the VERY best tuxedo!!!!!! Look no further....,"This is the VERY best tuxedo choice for any man that wants to look and feel great when attending any formal event.  I was initially concerned about the quality since the price was so affordable. However, I’m really impressed with the quality and design of the tuxedo. It looks exactly as shown in the pictures and the quality is very superb.  The fabric feels just as nice at the ones you rent but you get to keep yours and wear it over and over again!  The pants are unhemmed so you can get your local tailor to hem them to meet your preferred length.  Overall, I give this a thousand stars because the tux is very well made, the price is super affordable and the customer service is superb.  They respond to your questions very quickly and help you find the right size based on your body measurements.  I love them so much that I ordered eight of them for my groom and all his groomsmen for our upcoming wedding.  I highly recommend this tuxedo.  Father’s day is coming up and this is an excellent option for a father’s day gift.  You can use it for weddings, funerals, Prom, Formal dinners, Cruises and just about any occasion."
Didn't work for me,"Boxes wouldn't stay in tact, kept falling apart and I still had problems.  A waste."
Perfect match with my living room rugs.,Love the design.they look great with the large rug and runner I have.
Too big i returned it,Nice but too big
Factory mistake.,Look at the assembly mistake on the top row. I can only use 3/4. I really needed that 4th one. Not happy.
Do not buy leaks!!,Leaks! We used it for the first time since we bought it and no matter what we do we can’t tighten it enough. Its on tight but it still shoots out water!!!
Way overpriced,Way overpriced.
Es más barato en otros lados.,Motiva mucho a los niños a usarlo
The RIGHT tool to buy.,Guide pin size selection is excellent.  Functioned perfectly as designed and advertised
Easy to use,They are easy to work with. And product turns out great.
WORKS WELL!!,Product works well and it is easy to use!!
Perfect,So adorable.
Not what I ordered,I ordered 24 pieces and only received 4
if I can give a negative star I would,The product leaked all over the bottom of the box as shown in the delivery picture once open it all in the plastic bag.
paper wishes is great,"I've been getting these cards and envelopes from paper wishes for years, if I had known they were coming from paper wishes i would have just ordered from them but I am very happy with them, and the envelopes are big enough to fit  the card even with layers, foam tape and embellishments"
Pockets do not stay closed with the current velcro.,"I work in a Safeway Fuel Station in Newport, WA.  My boss purchased a Dib Safety Vest for me previously.  I ordered another one so I would not have to wash the one I already have so frequently.  My only complaint is that the pockets do not stay closed with the velcro.  I am forever trying to re-close them.  Otherwise, I love everything else about the vest."
Don’t waste your money,Piece of cloth with no cooling observed whatsoever.
I love this soap,This soap works great !
Needs some tweaking,"I purchased this as only a rear support harness.  If it is not attached to anything at the front half of the body it will slide off my dog rather easily.  I also had to modify the belly band because, despite the u shaped area for male dogs, it continually got peed on.  I ended up just wrapping the whole belly band with self adhesive wrap to keep that piece out of the way.  It's not perfect but it works for now.  It is far superior to not having anything at all and provides good stability for my DM Boxer."
works well,easy to use and a “MUST HAVE” to reset TPMS system after moving tires to different position
WOW! KEiiD Nailed It!,"The sound quality is everything I was hoping for. Rich, warm Bass, Crisp, clean Treble. Every song sounds better than I expected, so I keep going from one favorite song to the next. The controls are easy to figure out and when you ask it to do something, it does it instantly. It has plenty of volume. Half way up, is all the distortion free volume my ears can handle. Everything about this machine just shouts: ""High quality and very well thought out."""
TaoTronics vs Homech Tower Fan,"They are almost identical. Homech is slightly taller and narrower but a bit nosier, and the bottoms are located on the top, not in the front like TaoTronic so this is just personal preference. The base, both are not very steady. Personally, I like TaoTronics a bit more."
Working Great,"Working great, no complaints"
Fit,Would not fit over my teeth to short from  top to bottom
Just get it,"I love everything about it, especially the adjustable clip. Is much thinner than other holster I've tried making is more comfortable and less noticeable"
Does the job just fine,"We recently ran out of butane on our old flexible neck gas lighter, which has lasted us near a decade (we obviously don't light many things, other than the occasional birthday candles). Decided to see what's new in the world of lighter technology and saw these newfangled plasma arc lighters and had to give it a try. This brand seems to have the most established presence, and I chose this model because of the extra safety slider over the activation button (seems a bit more failsafe when this goes into a drawer). The lighter does the job just fine, lighting candles with ease. We've already made use of it several times due to a couple recent unexpected power outages. Not sure how well the tip will stand up over time, but it's nice not having to get butane refills."
Perfect Part,This part was a perfect fit for my Chevy S10. I have installed the part and it does the job quit well. I now have all my blower speeds for my air and heat in the truck. Thanks
Light brown color is more reddish brown,"Tried this because it's cheaper than my usual brand. It works ok, however the light brown is more of a medium reddish brown."
Beat buy,Great work right away
love love love!!!,"last year i lost my childhood best friend, i’ve wanted something in memory of her for awhile now and couldn’t decide on what to buy. i ran across these necklaces while scrolling through Amazon, i cant even begin to put into to words how much i love it. it doesn’t replace her but its something small to carry around and keep her memory with me."
Double door dilemma,"I was replacing the same unit that went bad.  Water somehow got in and corroded the battery terminals.  Hope it won't happen on the replacement.  It was hard to get the second door programmed, I found the steps a little confusing.  Now it's programmed, it will only operate one door ""at a time"", meaning if I operate door 1, I can't operate door 2 right away, I need to wait until the remote is no longer working door 1 so I can input the code and select door 2.  A bit of a pain."
No bones in soup,Prevents any bony remnants from turning up in soup (aargh). Great way to add flavorful spices while keeping broth clear and uniform.
"Great vaule,  great price, great lights",Loved these lights!!! Better and brighter than the first one I bought. 4 lights really make a difference!!! Light up my garage and highly recommend!
Works better than anything I've tried over the years,"This extremely absorbant cream goes on easily and leaves no residue.  When used regularly it is effective. I've used many foot creams in the past,  but the ingredients in this product is noticeably making the difference."
really good cards and envelopes!,"i absolutely love the colours of these cards! they’re really good material as well!! the only issue i had at first was that i couldn’t use regular markers on them, so i had to use sharpies, but i used metallic ones a few times and they look great!"
Cozy nightie,It is soft and very comfortable.
Cute but not worth so much money,The outside and the little individual boxes inside are cute and plastic but the separators are very flimsy cardboard.  It works but it leaves me concerned it won’t last long. Not worth the $35 I paid for it.
works as described,wokred as it should. comes in handy to have incase you ever have to use again
Quality,Great instructions and build quality!!
Love them!,I been looking for these for months and I finally got them! They’re so good!
Noice,It stand up on its own. It has an expensive look that elevates my fit
Great product,I’ve been struggling to use regular eyelashes. I always mess up with a glue but this one is a game changer. Super easy to apply the liner (just need to wait a bit to dry) and apply the lashes. No mess and takes minimum of time to do it. Would definitely recommend this product.
crystal clear night vision.,The night vision on this dash cam is superb compared to the last dash cam I own. I can zoom in on the license plates and view them as clear as daytime. The free SD card that comes with it is also sweet.
Nope!,Nope not very good at all.  Does not protect the charging cord from bending.  I would not buy again!
Not Sturdy - broke on first use,"Bought this item for the sheer number of screws, nuts and spacers as well as the innovative storage arrangement. Unfortunately, on the latter the product disappointed completely as it broke on first use. Construction is flimsy and not appropriate to support the relatively heavy weight to carry the 3 compartments as a single unit. Furthermore on 2 of 3 compartments one of the latches to hold the lid with the rest of the body don't close properly"
Cute Easter Bags,"The bags were smaller than I thought (my fault), but I just filled them up.  Very colorful."
Love it,"I love how it made my hair feel . I  am in love with they way my 4b hair looks after use, you can see all my natural  waves in my hair"
Not soft. Very thin,Very thin and flimsy. Does not add any cushion or softness.
Cheap chinese garbage.,"Every time you shoot the dot moved where you set it, wouldn't recommend for even air-soft."
None,Like it
Worth the price,"Fit well, and helped reduce headaches when gaming"
Nice,Great
Pick these!!,"These lights are awesome, they turned by bath time into magic! Creates great ambiance and relaxation with the color changing function. And it's magnetic so it sticks to the side of the tub which is another great feature. You would not regret this purchase!!"
As advertised,Great nail brushes!
thank you! good quality! fast delivery! i am happy,thank you! good quality! fast delivery! i am happy
Fixed,Worked well and went on easy even for one person doing it
Great Dog Food,"This is premium dog food.  I typically purchase this food by going to my local pet food store.  But with the Covid Virus, I decided to purchase from Amazon this time.  My dog is 14 years old and very healthy.  This is a great food for her."
Very bright,"I got this hoping it would replace an outdoor florescent blub in an outdoor fixture(9142b), but that did not work; this did not meet the power requirements. However this has found a home in my basement where it is very bright and lights the whole area with a single bulb. I would recommend for a workshop or somewhere that needs a large area lit with minimal fixtures."
Easy Peasy!,Was surprised how easy this was to install.
Love it,I added patches
Cute,Love it.  Perfect for my cell phone wallet
INEFFECTIVE,Sprayed two bottles on patches where nutsedge was growing in my lawn. All it did was turn the blades brown. It does not kill the roots. I have just as much nutsedge as before I used this product.
Good Quality,My Boulder loves this bed????????????????❤????
Super cute,It’s super cute bigger then I thought it was gonna be. It is wrapped very well in a styrofoam type material and didn’t have any cracks or breaks!!! My mail lady is just awful so super happy it’s not broken. It came earlier then it said it would arrive which I was also happy about that.
Great Product,"Great product, keeps my tea warm or hot whichever i want"
It's a toy camera,Granson loves it
Not a bang for your buck,"No absorbency, and when washed produces many fuzz balla"
Affordable,"Functions very well and very affordable , nice alternative to Apple Pencil"
Good quality,My feet was happy about it. The stretch did not change even after washing it hot water several kind
Great quality,I was really surprised with the quality of these censored lights and with the quality of the solar panel for the price they haven't posted is dirty compared to any other store
Great Balloons,"Very nice, beautiful color and quality!"
Would buy again.,"Almost no sound, cats love it. Would buy again."
definitely helps,It is the best at reducing frequency of urination; I haven't been able to tell if that is prostate squeezing less or change in bladder muscle but the net result is not having to go as often.
Perfect!,Perfect on my living room wall
Sturdy,Sturdy. Not cheaply made.  Good quality for the $$.
very cute well made just needs more elastic  for us curvy girls,Not strechable
showerhead,easy to install and good spray pattern
Just what he needed,Nephew got great use of these in college class
Works well.,"Worked as described, easy to apply."
