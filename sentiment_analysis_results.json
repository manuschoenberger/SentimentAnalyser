When I went to find out what the lights meant, the first time I read that I had an inadequate transformer. Great! So my first issue with this system is that it can't work with transformers that are already in your house. You have to have a special transformer on your doorbell. If you have anything other than a modern home, you might want to check your transformer before getting this doorbell. Apparently there is not enough power in the standard transformer for this item.",
